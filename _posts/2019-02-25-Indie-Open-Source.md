Over the past few years, I've had an incredible number of deep conversations about open source business models with solo hackers and small firms off the VC-funded track.  Nearly all of those calls ended the same way:

> We should really get together and do something about how hard it is for indies to find out about business models that work for them.

At some point, I started adding these folks to an empty GitHub organization, [indieopensource](https://github.com/indieopensource).  Today, I'm pleased to announce that the org is no longer empty.  We've begun fleshing out [indieopensource.com](https://indieopensource.com) as the resource we all wish we'd had ourselves, much earlier.

Within scope:

- [guides to business models](https://indieopensource.com/for-indies#business-model-guides) that work well for solo and small-firm developers, like [paid support](https://indieopensource.com/paid-support/indies) and [public-private licensing](https://indieopensource.com/public-private/indies)

- explainers for [users](https://indieopensource.com/for-users) and [outside contributors](https://indieopensource.com/for-contributors) of projects running those models

- a [showcase of companies](https://indieopensource.com/indies) running those models, like [Metafizzy](https://metafizzy.co) and [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org)

- a collection of [legal forms](https://indieopensource.com/forms) useful for those models, including a [paid license](https://github.com/indieopensource/paid-license), a [support contract](https://github.com/indieopensource/support-contract), and a [tiny contributor license agreement](https://github.com/indieopensource/tiny-cla)

- a directory of [service providers](https://indieopensource.com/services) helping to make business models cheaper and easier to run

We're [not stressing what it means to be an "indie"](https://indieopensource.com/scope).  Rather, we're sending out a signal to collect new writing, data, and tools for mutual aid.  We're trying to become a shared and codeveloped resource.

As for contribution, the project is very young, and has all the needs: design, writing, links, data about companies and service providers.  The action is [all under the GitHub organization](https://github.com/indieopensource), especially the [repository for indieopensource.com](https://github.com/indieopensource/indieopensource.github.io).
