I've published a new website, [notlegaladvice.law](https://notlegaladvice.law), that I can link to for explanation of "This is not legal advice.", "I'm a lawyer, but I'm not _your_ lawyer.", "for informational purposes only", and similar disclaimers.

Others should feel free to link to and reference it as they see fit, and to send me constructive feedback by e-mail.

One analogy that occured to me while writing, but didn't seem to fit on a general-interest page: The phrases we're used to hearing before lawyer's presentations work a bit like the warranty disclaimers and damages exclusions---the parts in `ALL CAPITAL LETTERS`---of open licenses.  Programmers giving away software don't want to face warranty or incompetence claims, and lawyers giving away legal information don't want to face malpractice or competence claims.
