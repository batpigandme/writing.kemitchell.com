- [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) and [Linode](https://linode.com) for virtual private servers running Linux

- [FastMail](https://fastmail.com) for e-mail

- [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) for RSS

- [Lob.com](https://lob.com) for sending postal mail

- [Oxford English Dictionary](https://oed.com) for dictionary and thesaurus
