If you're a US lawyer, translator, or copyeditor interested in publishing forms and guidance for advance medical directives, powers of attorney, medical proxies, and other end-of-life care documents as COVID-19 ramps up, please e-mail me at [kyle@kemitchell.com](mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com).  We're forming a working group.

I'm particularly interested in those willing to help research and prepare guides to meeting signature, evidentiary, and other practical requirements under social-distancing, stay-at-home, and hospital-quarantine conditions.
