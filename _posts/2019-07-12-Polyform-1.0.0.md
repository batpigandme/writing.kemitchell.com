[Polyform Project](https://polyformproject.org), which I helped to found, [released version 1.0.0s of five new software licenses earlier this week](https://polyformproject.org/2019/07/09/version-1/).

If you've ever wanted a standard, noncommercial license for source code, [Polyform has provided](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0).  I cannot overstate how overdue that is.  Those of us who work in both software and media licensing have long seen obvious gaps comparing the full spectrum of [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses) to [those standardized for software](https://spdx.org/licenses/).  Authors of other media---music, art, film, and so on---have long had standardized licenses choices that software people did not.

Careful readers will notice the same plain, short style of the [Blue Oak Model License](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0) and my own [API Copyleft License](https://github.com/kemitchell/api-copyleft-license).  That is the result of more lawyers, technologists, and businesspeople than I could remember to list here.  I am so happy to see plain, approachable language become more and more the norm in next-generation public software licenses.

Other readers will recall my previous solo attempt at a noncommercial software license: the noncommercial license for [License Zero](https://licensezero.com), [Prosperity](https://licensezero.com/licenses/prosperity).  That license saw adoption in [surprising places](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/master/LICENSE), a testament to pent-up demand for terms of its kind.
