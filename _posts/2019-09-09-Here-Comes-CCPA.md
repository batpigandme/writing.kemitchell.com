California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act by referendum.  It goes into effect January 1, 2020.  Brace yourself for hot new privacy policy changes!

I've published [ccpa.kemitchell.com](https://ccpa.kemitchell.com), my personal copy of the statute.  The website has linkable HTML IDs for all major elements, so it's possible to link to specific sections, subsections, and definitions:

- Section 1798.105:

  <https://ccpa.kemitchell.com/#1798.105>

- The definition of "business":

  <https://ccpa.kemitchell.com/#business>

- The annual gross revenue threshold within that definition:

  <https://ccpa.kemitchell.com/#1798.140-c-1-A>

I've also begun color-coding relevant sections and indexing major topics, like the new consumer rights and disclosure obligations.

I did [something similar for GDPR](https://gdpr.kemitchell.com) back in the day.  Seems like forever ago now.
