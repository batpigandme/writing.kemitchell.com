title: Whitelist and Blacklist
description: What is the right thing to do?
---

I've seen and been sent a few sources on moving away from the terms "whitelist" and "blacklist" for "list of things approved or allowed" and "list of things disapproved or prohibited".  I've used both terms in the past, as well as "greylist".  For example, [in this post about how to develop ethically motivated codes of conduct for users of creative work](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/03/15/Ethical-Subcommons.html#describe-acceptable-conduct).

Taking action on words is still words, not properly actions.  I've no desire to make more of this, for my own benefit, than it is.  But this was one of those usage patterns that simply never occurred to me as reinforcing views and stereotypes with which I strongly disagree and work to redress.  The conversation took my surprise.

I'd be very interested to hear from folks on what, if anything, I should do on this.  Especially from those who feel wrong by the bias involved.  I could:

- Replace "blacklist" and "whitelist" here on this blog, and elsewhere.

- Replace those terms, but make the replacement explicit:

  > You can put the conduct you want to prohibit on a <del>blacklist</del><ins>stop list</ins> and incorporate it by reference.

  I could also link those changes to separate page with a short statement of motivation for the replacement.

- Do nothing, and make new choices about which terms to use going forward.

It's tough to choose what I might replace the terms with.  Perhaps "green list", "yellow list", and "red list".  Or "go list", "caution list", and "stop list".
