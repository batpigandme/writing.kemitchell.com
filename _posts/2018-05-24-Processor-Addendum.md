I've published [a plain-language contract addendum for GDPR processors][github] that covers processor requirements, and incorporates standard clauses for transfer as needed.

Comments and proposed improvements are most welcome, [privately, by e-mail](mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com) or [publicly, on GitHub][github].
