_Update:  Thanks to some great feedback, this license form has evolved considerably.  See [the latest draft on commonform.org](https://commonform.org/kemitchell/proprietary-software-license/latest) for the most recent text._

I'm working on a short, minimal, but adaptable paid software license.  I'd be grateful for feedback from colleagues and _especially_ non-lawyer programmers and business people.

You can [make comments on this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rgmbrS92_mGmMg8kuL9uWThtLtH99k13qkqPOaDx6jc/edit?usp=sharing).

The terms work with an "Order Form" that sets out essential details and key terms, like who is buying from who, what software they're buying, what versions are covered, and whether the vendor is agreeing to an extended patent warranty.  Vendor and customer sign the order form, which references the legal terms.
