I'm pleased to announce publication of the Switchmode Developer Agreement, a freely available form contract for open-source developers doing a mix of open- and closed-project work for paying clients.  The most recent drafts are available on [commonform.org](https://commonform.org/kemitchell/switchmode/latest) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kemitchell/switchmode/releases).

I'll plan to review a version of the form line-by-line here on the blog when time permits.  Until then, the best introduction is the [project `README` file](https://github.com/kemitchell/switchmode/blob/master/README.md), which already has an overview of structure and banner features.

I'm very eager to receive feedback and improvements from others.  The [`CONTRIBUTING` file](https://github.com/kemitchell/switchmode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)  has "wishlists" of feedback, from both software people and fellow lawyers.  Best case, this transforms quickly from "Kyle's form" to something that belongs to the community at large, with due to credit to all those pitching in, however they're able.  Part of rewriting something like this, from scratch, in plain language, is to ensure that users, and not just their lawyers, can read, adapt, and improve it.

As a final note, I've applied [my first practical crack at a public license for "open" legal forms](https://github.com/kemitchell/switchmode/blob/master/LICENSE) to the project.  Feedback is also welcome on that text, in its [own repository](https://github.com/kemitchell/law-form-license).
