Heather Meeker just posted [_Musings on the Eternal Questions of Patent Indemnities_](https://heathermeeker.com/2019/06/26/musings-on-the-eternal-question-of-patent-indemnities/), a short, neat, and high-level compilation of notes and arguments on the issue of who bears what risk of a patent suit about a paid product or service.

I've added Heather's post to a [new reference list of good blog posts on the topic](https://reference.kemitchell.com/patent-risk.html).  If you know of another blog post, article, talk recording, or other resource that belongs on that list, [let me know!](mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com)
