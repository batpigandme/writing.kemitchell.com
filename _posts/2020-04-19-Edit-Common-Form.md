As promised, I've just launched [edit.commonform.org](https://edit.commonform.org), which lets folks try Common Form's numbering, formatting, and checking tools without installing anything.  It's also a great way to try out [Common Form's typing conventions](https://type.commonform.org).

It's brand new, and there are quirks.  For example, issues with defined terms, references, and usage do get recognized automatically, but don't yet show up next to the appropriate lines.  I'll get to that.  I want it, too.

In the meantime, big credit goes to [Marijn Haverbeke](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/), developer of [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/), the editor component that powers the site.

I've just sent Marijn a new donation.  Others relying on CodeMirror, ProseMirror, and his other work should [do the same](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/fund/).
