As of [version 6.13.0 of the npm command-line interface](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v6.13.0), package developers can now include information about how to help fund their projects in `package.json`:


```json
{
  "funding": {
    "type": "individual",
    "url": "https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/fund/"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "funding": {
    "type": "patreon",
    "url": "https://pateon.com/feross"
  }
}
```

By default, when users run `npm install` to install dependencies, the npm CLI will notify them that some installed package have funding data and prompt the user to run `npm fund`.  `npm fund` can print reports of funding data, including in JSON with `--json`, and open links in the browser with `--browser`.
