Philosophically, free and open source licensing means non-discrimination.

Practically, open source licensing often discriminates, intentionally and effectively.  Especially in favor of those with exclusive rights that open source licensing doesn't account for.

Companies making money on open source, or scoring strategic business victories by its release, are charging for _something else_.  Those making _good_ money have some bulwark---an exclusive right---that protects their ability to earn well from competitors who would happily earn less to take a piece of the action.  Everyone has the _right_ to make money, but the company can _exclude_ them from doing so.  Hence "exclusive right".

Practitioners of open source have become fairly familiar with certain obvious forms of exclusive rights: patents, or exclusive rights to practice and sell inventions, and trademarks, exclusive rights to use a name or logo to identify products and services you provide.  Open source was initially laser-focused on copyright, but has bumped into other forms of intellectual property, time and time again.

Practitioners of open source remain far less familiar with exclusive rights outside intellectual property.

For example, in some industries, companies require government approvals, regulatory licenses, or private certifications to do business.  Those rights often apply only to the specific company that obtains them, rather than to its software or product category, and cover organizational as well as technical criteria.  When those rights prove prohibitively expensive or simply impractical for anyone else to obtain, they become effectively exclusive.

Companies holding those exclusive rights can freely release their software as open source.  They hold a greater power---the exclusive right---that makes the lesser power of licensing irrelevant.  Having released, contributions may come back.  But other contributors aren't free to operationalize or commercialize the results.  Overall, the system discriminates against them.  But the software is "open source", because open source doesn't account for that kinds of exclusivity.

Exclusive rights may be even less formal, based not in law, but in market circumstances.  Some firms dominate whole commercial categories, due to overwhelming brand recognition, entrenched or exclusive supplier relationships, or market power, manifest as cartel or monopoly control.  These firms effectively own chunks of customer brain space throughout the addressable market, as homeowners own property in their neighborhoods.  Even if a competitor has all rights needed to offer a competing product or service, they may not be able to make anyone aware it exists, or sell it to them.

When business theorists speak of "network effects", they refer, in one manner of speaking, to self-reinforcing, informal exclusive rights.  They speak of an antidote to, or protection from, competition.  Software companies benefiting from strong network effects are prolific sources of open source release.  They have graduated, in a sense, to a level of competition where the kinds of exclusive rights that open source neutralizes---copyright, perhaps patent---no longer matter.

Consider Kubernetes.  I am sure it's good technology.  It's certainly well promoted, and well marketed.  So much so, in fact, that I'm reasonably sure a great number of enthusiastic adopters have, frankly, no need for such complexity, given the nature of their applications.  But the name recognition and technical reputation of Google, the massive budget Google has thrust behind it, and the dynamics of new-hotness in software engineering conspire to make Kubernetes an industry force.

That force was utterly calculated.  Google pushes Kubernetes to crack open the market dominance of Amazon Web Services.  [Here's their guy saying so.](https://youtu.be/L7WKHLpm4wc?t=156)

RESUME HERE

There is one universal exclusive right in software: creators of software have the right to share it, or to keep it secret.  This is the cornerstone of the "source" part of "open source".  Merely granting the right license for the wrong kind of material---say, obfuscated source or compiled binary---doesn't make the software open source.

Copyright is only slightly less universal than the right to share or keep secret. Under US law, copyright applies to nearly any code, so long as it evidences some degree of creativity.
