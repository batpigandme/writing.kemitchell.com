Love it or hate it, one of the neat things GitHub did, mashing social network and source control together, was create a source of online, affiliation-fluid identity for Open Source people.  GitHub's API is happy to report that I have been [@kemitchell](https://api.github.com/users/kemitchell) since February 18, 2010.  In time since, I've marched under many flags---of clients, employers, universities, and foundations---sometimes a few at a time.  But [@kemitchell](https://github.com/kemitchell) I have been, and shall remain.  Not k.e.mitchell@someco.com last week.  Not @otherco/kyle the next.

Frankly, it couldn't really _work_, socially, any other way.  No more than Twitter could work if every move, job change, or relationship induced a new account, a new handle, a blank page.  "Please update your address book..."

Identity that's _persistent_ in the Facebook-esque, social-network way---a consequence of being _fluid_ in all these other dimensions---makes it easy, nay, possible, for me to associate myself with my presence there, to _identify_ in a shockingly visceral way with what "@kemitchell" means on some appliance called github.com.  Identify in a way I never could with, say, a LinkedIn profile or a work e-mail address.

Don't get me wrong.  I use @kemitchell for work all the time.  This can make for awkwardness on the other side.  Is @kemitchell weighing in here in his hacker-hobbyist capacity?  On behalf of some client paying for his work?  Setting aside all my lawyer hats, and assuming just @kemitchell the coder, which hat am I wearing?  "@kemitchell" itself doesn't say.  Compared to many popular, public-Internet identity systems of the past, that's a glaring omission.

Glaring in that frame, but suspiciously irrelevant in practice, the vast majority of the time.  Sometimes it matters, and folks bring it up.  But mostly, it just doesn't.  People don't feel that way.

When I deal with people who know me---personally, professionally, or just through GitHub---they identify @kemitchell with their experience of me.  They judge what @kemitchell says and does in light of those experiences.  They may even assume my motivations---or to some extent my affiliations---are also good, to the extent they think I'm good.  In fact, they may forget entirely that I have very good, publicly acknowledged work reasons to disagree or steer clear of a question, and @-mention me on it anyway.  A mistake, but a very easy one to make.

I'd like to think GitHub has brought some of this kind of transitive, person-to-person regard, very common among independents of various stripes---coders, designers, copywriters, lawyers---to the world of the employed.  Or perhaps brought the Company Man a little closer to startup culture on a continuum, halfway between freelance and lifer.  Contractor and venture culture are much worse than large companies in many other aspects, but not, methinks, in this one.

I see a parallel to this social dynamic in the permission we tend to give for work we do on GitHub.  Highly permissive Open Source licenses, like [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT), don't care what motivates users, either.  Perhaps they're writing tools to uplift a downtrodden indigenous community.  Perhaps they're teaching a robot to play glockenspiel.  Perhaps they're gunning for riches in the belly of the surveillance-industrial complex.  MIT doesn't care.  And as I slap MIT on my own code, thinking of my friends, or more folks like them that I'd like to meet, reasons to care are far from my mind.  If indigenous empowerment, glockenspiel, or dirty money float a friend's boat in the moment, on some fuzzy, general level, I'm all for it.

Building out a life here in Oakland, across the bridge from San Francisco, I landed on a kind of credo:  If I help you with some software for a project at [Sudo Room](https://sudoroom.org), the [Transbay Tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transbay_Tube) doesn't make you any less welcome to my gift by the time you get to work.  You are you.  Here, there, and everywhere.  I'm on your team through each phase, as it comes and goes.  And so much grander the gift if I don't ask to know for myself how it benefits, or perhaps even who.

Most coders that I talk to---City, Town, or Valley---like this tune.  It sounds deeply in the kind of persistence, the identity instincts, that we share.  But in part because it feels so easily _right_, because it seems to gather force from subconscious depths, I'm suspicious.  I believe, very deeply, that generosity ranks a virtue.  But if feeling this way is the default, on account of being human, where does that default go wrong, and how do those errors add up?  Where could we do better, if we sought knowledge from experience, informed our conscience, and applied our minds?  And is that improvement worth the cost of reflection?

Affiliation-fluid online identity helps us forget about affiliations.  Sometimes we should.  Sometimes we shouldn't.

Compelling online identity leads us to substitute thoughts and feelings about those we know for thoughts and feelings we ought to have about a system chock full of strangers.  Sometimes that's saintly.  Sometimes it's blind.

Stripping context away from interactions and exchanges stop us remembering all the expectations we've learned to have, based on subtle hints and background.  Some of that's baggage.  Some of it's wisdom.

Consider the drama of payment.  For those unaccustomed to direct involvement in "doing business", taking and making payment among individuals is awkward, a faux pas.  Like sorting out the bill for a meal on the town, when a certain someone has clearly ate and drunk a somewhat sum than others.  Unless you have to care, don't.

For those accustomed to doing business, by choice or necessity, "humdrum" is the word.  Doing business _is_ payment, valuation, negotiation.  Splitting the bill right is _correct_.  There may be feelings to feel about how correctness gets sorted out.  But not in the outcome, if it's right.

In a well functioning business community, stuffed with repeat players, payment is the punctuation of any good story, integral to the telling of it, not a jarring interruption.  Information flows, and so does money.  Money _conveys_ a lot of information, often very effectively.  Figuring out where it should go can be a matter of optimization.  Exploiting the occasional, unresolved error a source hacker-esque, impish reward.

When we interact people-to-people, and the context switches to business, we face a choice.  One we might prefer to ignore, depending on what we call comfortable.  Assume both sides know, somehow, that the context has gone from buddy-buddy to buddy-business.  GitHub doesn't help---that's the first problem---but assume it.  Does payment come up?  Compensation for time?  Opportunity to support, invest, head off risk?

In the main, no.  Not in my experience.

Exceptions there are. They correlate nicely with presence of players blooded in as entrepreneurs or freelancers.  People familiar with expectations in business situations, and ruffled little or none by the meeting of them.  Flip side, students, hobbyists, and employees sufficiently insulated from the business of business at their businesses tend to say nothing at all about money on GitHub, ever.  Why would they?  They feel no malfunction, no _wrongness_, when a pull request takes a dozen hours of solo maintainer time, resulting in a feature-add benefiting, in the moment, exactly one for-profit user.  If another pull request takes a dozen hours of an employee-colleague's time on the private repo, what's the difference?

In informal, non-business situations, which even the business-iest of businessmen preserve in their private lives, we trust these imbalances to work themselves out over time.  Or we simply accept that any aggregate loss gets offset by something not counted.  I close your PR.  Later on, you'll close one of mine.  Or one of my friend's, whose time you'll sop up on a bug.  Nobody really wants to value and count all this up, only to end up near zeroes all the way across.  So why bother counting?

A perfectly good question, in the community as we feel it is, full of friends and potential friends.  But we know that's not the reality, as it really stands.  We're well aware of structural imbalances that make zeroes across the board unlikely.  We know that Open Source thrives on radical imbalance between development input and use-value output.  We know that when buddy-buddy becomes buddy-business, it benefits business to make on like buddy-buddy, and that the pressures of business will encourage that approach.  We know, in short, that we could probably count up the gives and takes for all of our friends on GitHub, and end up near zeroes as far as we go.  But there are massive accounts out there in the negative, and the difference is no less costly for being spread across the personal accounts of volunteers, who couldn't have been hired legally as interns for nothing, which is exactly what they'll be paid.

One model of Open Source boils down, in essence, to deduplication of effort in generic infrastructure or "utility" code for funded development projects.  On this model, it's quite natural to expect that databases and dev tools and ports from one language to another will be largely open, and the integration compositions thereof, with which users actually interact, will be closed.  On this model, it's quite natural to wonder why anyone without a salary, a stable 1099 flow, or tuition paid would work on Open Source, especially off the clock.  On this model, software developers as a culture, their mores and ethics, don't matter.  If you want to sell Internet censorship software to Eritrea, far easier to get your orchestration framework from a distributed team of developers, all of whom might keep EFF stickers on their laptops, but who happen to chose an Open source license, than to strike a balance between competence and the cost of suspending conscience for a willing in-house developer.
