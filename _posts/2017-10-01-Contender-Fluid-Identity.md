Building out a life here in Oakland, across the bridge from San Francisco, I landed on a kind of credo:  If I'd help you with some code at [Sudo Room](https://sudoroom.org), the [Transbay Tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transbay_Tube) doesn't make you any less welcome to my code by the time you get to work.  You are you.  Here, there, and everywhere.

Most coders that I talk to---[City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco), [Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California), or [Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley)---like this song.  It resonates with the rapport and idealized independence that we share and celebrate, even if we take public-company jobs with retirement plans and health insurance.  But in part because it feels so easily _right_, because it seems to gather force from subconscious depths, I'm suspicious.  Does this indifference to role and commitment play out in practice as good as it feels?

Consider how new the elevation of this individualism is, not just since our parents' generation, but in our own lifetimes.  Love it or hate it, one thing GitHub did, mashing social network and source control together, was create a source of global, affiliation-fluid online identity for software people.  [I have been @kemitchell since February 18, 2010.](https://api.github.com/users/kemitchell)  During that time, I've marched under many flags---clients', employers', universities', and foundations'---sometimes a few at a time.  But [@kemitchell](https://github.com/kemitchell) I have been, and shall remain.  Not k.e.mitchell@someco.com last week.  Not @otherco/kyle next week.

Frankly, it couldn't really _work_ any other way, socially.  No more than Twitter could work if every move, job change, or relationship induced a start from scratch, a new account, a new handle, mass pleas to update address books.  Identity that's persistent in the social-network way---a consequence of being fluid in all these other dimensions---makes it easy, nay, possible, to associate with my incorporeal presence there, to _identify_ at a shockingly visceral level with what "@kemitchell" means on some public appliance called github.com.  Identify in a way I never could with, say, a work e-mail address, or even a me@gmail.com.

Don't get me wrong.  I use @kemitchell on GitHub for work all the time.  And awkwardness sometimes results.  Is @kemitchell appearing here in his hobbyist capacity?  On behalf of some paying client, renting his reputation by the hour?  Setting aside all my lawyer hats, and assuming just @kemitchell the coder, whose flag am I flying?  "@kemitchell" doesn't say.  Compared to many popular, public-Internet identity systems of the past, that's a glaring omission.

Glaring in that frame, but conspicuously irrelevant in practice, the vast majority of the time.  Sometimes it matters, and folks bring it up.  But mostly, it just doesn't.  People don't feel that way.  The appliance, its interface, its model of identity all discourage such feelings.

When I deal with people who know me---personally, professionally, or even exclusively as @kemitchell---they identify @kemitchell with their experience.  They judge what @kemitchell says and does in the context of those experiences.  They may even project their feelings about @kemitchell onto my affiliations, spoken and unspoken:  If I'm not so bad, perhaps whoever I'm working for couldn't be so bad, either.  In that way, I'd like to think GitHub has brought some transitive, mercenary regard, characteristic of independents---coders, designers, writers, lawyers---to the world of the traditionally employed, drawing them somewhat closer to the startup midpoint between freelancer and lifer.

That's how I came up in software, and I'm biased. But the improvement I see doesn't lie in moving more people incrementally closer to the fealty-free, unbeholden agnosticism of hardcore [1099s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_1099).  Standing in the middle, and transitioning from one extreme toward another, teaches that there's a continuum in between,  a spectrum of expectations and practices to apply.  In other words, that there are choices to make.

The primary source of online identity for many of us has rocketed from the context-heaviness of something like kyle@someco.com, which calls attention to affiliation even when it _shouldn't_ matter, to the context-freedom of something like @kemitchell, which doesn't hint any affiliation even when it _should_.  Veterans of both systems shouldn't forget the lessons of either.  Meanwhile, a whole new generation is coming up on GitHub era, often well before their first jobs.  They shouldn't confuse the default in their time for a natural order.  There have always been choices to make in how we identify ourselves, and how we identify and interact with others.  There always will be.

So consider:

- Affiliation-fluid online identity on GitHub helps us forget about affiliations.  Sometimes we should.  Sometimes we shouldn't.

- Compelling online identity leads us to substitute thoughts and feelings about those we know for thoughts, feelings, and uncertainty we'd otherwise have about a system chock full of strangers.  Sometimes that's saintly.  Sometimes it's blind.

- Stripping context away from interactions and exchanges stops us remembering all the expectations we've developed, based on subtle hints and background.  Some of that's baggage.  Some of it's wisdom.

Consider the drama of payment.  For those unaccustomed to direct involvement in "doing business", taking and making payment among individuals can be profoundly awkward, to be avoided whenever possible for the sake of good grace and propriety.  Like sorting out the bill for a meal on the town, when a certain someone has clearly ate and drunk a princelier sum than others.  Unless you have to care, don't.

For those accustomed to doing business, by choice or necessity, all that's kind of ridiculous, a bit childlike.  "Humdrum" is the word for their experience.  Doing business _is_ payment, valuation, negotiation.  Splitting the bill right is _correct_.  There may be feelings to feel about how correctness gets determined.  But not about the outcome, if it's right.

In a well functioning business community, stuffed with repeat players, payment is the punctuation of any good story, its pauses, inflections, and emphases.  Integral to the telling, not any crude interruption.  Information flows, and so does money.  Money _conveys_ a lot of information, often very effectively.  Seeing it off to where it should go can be as dispassionate and abstract a challenge as bumming instructions off a program.  Exploiting a latent, unresolved flaw can be as much impish fun, and occasionally as lucrative, as a good hack.

When we interact people-to-people on GitHub, and the context switches to business, say on a pull request for a feature we need at work, we face a choice.  One we might prefer to ignore, depending on what we call comfortable.  Assume both sides know, somehow, that the context has gone from buddy-buddy to hobby on one side and business on the other.  GitHub doesn't help us recognize this---that's the first problem.  But if we realize anyway, does payment come up?  Compensation for time?  Opportunity to support, invest, head off risk?  A sense that good, honest work should earn a good, honest wage?  All the rest that's normal, and moral, when we're out to make a living?

In the main, no.  Not in my experience.

Where I see exceptions, there tends to be a high proportion of entrepreneur- and freelance-shaped developers in the mix.  In other words, developers familiar and comfortable with what's normal in business, developers capable of recognizing a business situation and taking it in stride, even as an opportunity.  Can I pay you to land this faster?  You're already working on the project; want to do that full time?  How can I establish that I respect you, and that you'll get a fair shake next time I come calling, and you answer?

On the flip side, students, hobbyists, and employees sufficiently insulated from "the business end of business" tend to say nothing at all about money or any other kind of exchange on or about GitHub, ever.  Why would they?  They feel no malfunction, no _wrongness_, when a pull request takes a dozen hours of solo maintainer time, resulting in a feature-add benefiting, in the moment, exactly one for-profit user.  If another pull request takes a dozen hours of an employee-colleague's time on the private repo, what's the difference?  We're all trying to learn, or toying around, or on salary.

In informal, non-business situations, which even the businessiest of businessmen preserve in their private lives, we trust these imbalances to work themselves out over time.  Or we accept that any aggregate loss probably gets offset by something we can't or don't bother counting.  I close your PR.  Later on, you'll close one of mine.  Or one of my friend's, whose time I sopped up on a bug.  Nobody really wants to count up, value, and settle all these scores, only to end up near enough to zeroes all the way 'round that no one cares.  So why bother keeping score?

A perfectly good question, in the community as we feel it is, full of friends and potential friends.  But we know that's not reality.

We know the asymmetries that make all zeroes unlikely.  We know that Open Source thrives on radical imbalance between developer effort going in and user benefit going out, that even "free" use creates more demands on maintainers.  We know that when buddy-buddy becomes buddy-business, it benefits business to make on like buddy-buddy as long as it can.  We know that the budget incentives and financial controls of business structure encourage getting away with that as long and as often as possible.  We know, in short, that we could probably count up the gives and takes for all of our friends on GitHub, and end up near zeroes as far as we go.  But there are massive accounts out there drawn deeply in the negative.  The debits corresponding to those credits amount to no less for being spread across the personal accounts of volunteers.  Volunteers who couldn't have been worked legally, as interns, for nothing, but will receive nothing all the same.

Or flip payment around, to donation.  We may get a slightly awkward feeling...

One model of Open Source boils down, in essence, to deduplication of effort in generic infrastructure or "utility" code for funded development projects.  On this model, it's quite natural to expect that databases and lint tools and ports from one language to another will be largely open, and that the integrating compositions thereof, with which users actually interact, which make meaningful choices about their lives, will be closed.  On this model, it's quite natural to wonder why anyone without a salary, a stable 1099 flow, or a full ride would work on Open Source, especially off the clock.  On this model, software developers as a culture, their mores and ethics, don't matter.  If you want to sell Internet censorship software to Eritrea, far easier to get your orchestration framework from a distributed team of developers, all of whom keep EFF stickers on their laptops, and license their work Apache-2.0, than to strike a balance between competence and the cost of suspending conscience for a willing in-house developer.

If all of this seems coarse, insensitive, faux pas, that's because it is.  It flows upstream of the social dynamics we've accepted, tacitly, by accepting identity structures like GitHub.

## Inevitably ... Licenses

I see a parallel to this social dynamic in the permission we tend to give for work we share through with our identities.  Highly permissive Open Source licenses, like [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT), don't care about user affiliation or motivation, either.  Perhaps they're writing tools to uplift a downtrodden indigenous community.  Perhaps they're teaching a robot to play glockenspiel.  Perhaps they're gunning for riches in the belly of the surveillance-industrial beast.  MIT doesn't care.  And as I slap MIT on my own code, thinking of my Internet friends, or more folks like them that I'd like to meet, reasons to care are far from my mind.  If indigenous empowerment, glockenspiel, or dirty money float a friend's boat in the moment, on some fuzzy, general level, I'm all for it.
