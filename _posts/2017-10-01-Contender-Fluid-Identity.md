Love it or hate it, one of the neat things GitHub did, mashing social network and source control together, was create a source of online identity for Open Source people that's necessarily affiliation-fluid.  GitHub's API is happy to report that I have been [@kemitchell](https://api.github.com/users/kemitchell) since February 18, 2010.  In the intervening time, I've marched under many flags---of clients, employers, universities, and foundations---sometimes a few at a time.  [@kemitchell](https://github.com/kemitchell) I have been, and shall remain.  Not k.e.mitchell@someco last week.  Not @otherco/kyle the next.

Frankly, it couldn't really _work_, socially, any other way.  No more than Twitter could work if every move, job change, or relationship induced a new account, a new handle, a blank page.  "Please update your address book..."

Identity that's _persistent_ in the Facebook-esque, social-network way---a consequence of being _fluid_ in all these other dimensions---makes it easy, nay, _possible_, for me to associate myself with my presence there, to _identify_ in a shockingly visceral way with what "@kemitchell" means on some appliance called github.com.  Identify in a way I never could with, say, a LinkedIn profile or a work e-mail address.

Don't get me wrong.  I use @kemitchell for work all the time.  This can make for awkwardness on the other side.  Is @kemitchell weighing in here in his hacker-hobbyist capacity?  On behalf of some client paying for his work?  Setting aside all my lawyer hats, and assuming just @kemitchell the coder, which hat am I wearing?  "@kemitchell" itself doesn't say.  Compared to many popular, public-Internet identity systems of the past, that's a glaring omission.

Glaring in that frame, but suspiciously irrelevant in practice, the vast majority of the time.  Sometimes it matters, and folks bring it up.  But mostly, it just doesn't.  People don't feel that way.

When I deal with people who know me, personally, professionally, or just through GitHub, they identify @kemitchell with their experience of me.  They judge what @kemitchell says and does in light of those experiences.  They may even assume my motivations---or to some extent my affiliations---are also good, to the extent they think I'm good.  In fact, they may forget entirely that I have very good, publicly acknowledged work reasons to disagree or steer clear of a question, and @-mention me on it anyway.  A mistake, but a very easy one to make.

I'd like to think GitHub has brought some of this kind of transitive, person-to-person regard, very common among independents of various stripes---coders, designers, copywriters, lawyers---to the world of the employed.  Or perhaps brought the Company Man a little closer to startup culture on a continuum, halfway between freelance and lifer.  Contractor and venture culture are much worse than large companies in many other aspects, but not, methinks, in this one.

I see a parallel to this social dynamic in the permission we tend to give for work we do on GitHub.  Highly permissive Open Source licenses, like [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT), don't care what motivates users, either.  Perhaps they're writing tools to uplift a downtrodden indigenous community.  Perhaps they're teaching a robot play glockenspiel.  Perhaps they're gunning for riches in the belly of the surveillance-industrial complex.  MIT doesn't care.  And as I slap MIT on my own code, thinking of my friends, or more folks like them that I'd like to meet, reasons to care are far from my mind.  If indigenous empowerment, glockenspiel, or dirty money float a friend's boat in the moment, on some fuzzy, general level, I'm all for it.

Building out a life here in Oakland, across the bridge from San Francisco, I landed on a kind of credo:  If I help you with some software for a project at [Sudo Room](https://sudoroom.org), the [Transbay Tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transbay_Tube) doesn't make you any less welcome to my gift when you get to work.  You are you.  Here, there, and everywhere.  I'm on your team, through every phase, as they come and go.  And so much grander the gift if I don't ask to know for myself how it benefits, or perhaps even who.

Most coders that I talk to---City, Town, or Valley---like the sound of this tune.  It resonates deeply in the kind of persistence, the identity instincts, that we share.  But in part because it feels so easily _right_, because it seems to gather force from subconscious depths, I'm suspicious of it.  I believe, very deeply, that generosity ranks a virtue.  But if feeling this way is the default, on account of being human, where does that default go wrong?  Where could we do better, if we sought knowledge from experience, informed our conscience, and applied our minds?
