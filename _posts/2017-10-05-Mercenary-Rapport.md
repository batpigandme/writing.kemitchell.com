_It's Thursday afternoon.  An employee at a large company opens a pull request on the company's preferred open source framework.  It takes six hours of maintainer time to close, over two weeknights and the weekend.  The pull request adds a feature of immediate use only to the company, which hires a consultancy to incorporate and deploy the change.  The consultancy bills eight hours.  Meanwhile, the employee uses their 20% Friday to work on their own, unfinished framework._

_Andy and Marie are Internet friends.  They hack on 3D rendering software together.  Andy lands a job at a design studio doing interactive work.  Marie's still in starving-artist mode.  Andy uses one of Marie's libraries on a work project, and sends her a request to support another file format.  Andy's so busy, he doesn't think to ask his boss about supporting Marie's work.  Meanwhile, Marie assumes it's for another Andy side project.  She writes the patch, but in no particular hurry.  Andy misses the client deadline._

_A startup selling network surveillance infrastructure to repressive national governments needs a deployment-orchestration tool.  Fortunately, they find a promising, MIT-licensed tool online.  The tool embodies several of engineer-years of volunteer work.  The lead maintainer sports a big EFF sticker on her laptop during her latest recorded conference talk.  She ends with a plea for financial support; she'd even flown to the conference on her own dime.  The startup can hire one less engineer._

Open source software is an identity, an identity I've worn most of my life.  Part of that identity is pride in community accomplishments.  Great software, available to all.  A new way of working and learning to work that shocks the conventional wisdom.

But part of open source identity is negative, too.  It's opposition to "proprietary software".  It's disdain for "the enterprise", heavy process, hierarchy, and the kind of software all that produces.

A little us-versus-them negativity is inevitable in any tribe worth joining.  And just as inevitably self-defeating.  Especially for those who identify strongly, but don't yet feel secure in their own positive contributions, even if they should.  Especially for those predisposed to take stereotypes of the other side too far, because they haven't yet been to the other side.

The business side of "enterprise" is all over open source these days.  Of course it is.  As it turns out, heaps of open source make it cheaper and easier to write proprietary software.  Some of that proprietary software is software-services the open source community itself chooses to rely upon.  And heaps of open source are great for business plans that only big business can run, like providing support, training, and other contracts to other enormous companies and governments.

Meanwhile, smaller project maintainers are learning to plead for money.  They have to.  Via ads in `README`.  Via colorful, ASCII-art terminal messages that show up on install.  The maintainers will admit this feels off, like it doesn't quite belong.  After all, we never see that kind of thing for open source projects out of big companies, or with big company backing.  But big players can afford open source as a loss leader, a marketing exercise, a recruiting tool.  Small players don't have that much to lose, or take serious personal hits losing it anyway.

Speaking of supported projects, the bureaucracy and process of some large ones can feel more like Kafka than building closed-source behind company doors.  It's entirely possible to open a pull request on a big project the day you apply for a big-company job, and get hired before you get merged.  There might be more Markdown to read in the project repo than paperwork to read for the job.  Contributors to the big project will readily admit this feels awfully bureaucratic, awfully _enterprisey_ for an open source project.  Companies can afford to insulate developers from many of the hassles of working that big.  Even primo foundations usually can't.

This is open source reality.  Intuitions not based in this reality are prone to error.  Those errors are adding up.  The community itself is compounding them, as it makes more choices, individually and collectively, based in unreality.

I have been a hobbyist, writing code for dopamine, as indifferent to industry as to whether it's raining in Prague.  I have seen the enterprise, and can tell a few stories.  I have been a freelancer, dancing at the feet of giants, getting things done.  And I've seen big changes to open source tools, platforms, and culture along the way.  Mine is no special wisdom.  None of my experience is unique.  But it all lends just enough perspective to spot a few dysfunctional patterns in open source today.

One of those patterns is wrongly conflating "proprietary" with money, "enterprise" with bigness, and, finally, money with bigness.  Mixing all that up infantilizes developers, deprives many in our community of basic moral education in the working world, and hides the hints that would otherwise tell us when small-business expectations can help us do right by one another a lot more of the time.  The net result, unsurprisingly enough, is of great benefit to big, proprietary software businesses, at the expense of big numbers of small community players.  Small players unintentionally complicit in propagating the error.

We can find this malfunction in our community a few ways.

## Contender-Fluid Identity

At dinner with friends, nobody really wants to talk about who did or didn't order more than everybody else, and by how much, when the bill comes.  But in business with the very same people, forthrightness about costs and compensation becomes a virtue.  Recognizing the value of others' time is in all enlightened operators' self-interest.  Communication has to be professional, and it ought to be expedient.  All in the service of spreading information around, so that dollars, cents, credits, and benefits stand a fighting chance of reflecting who put what in.

That's the _correct_ outcome.  It was part of every repeat player's job to facilitate that correctness.  It was part of of every repeat player's reputation to adjust, within their discretion, to offset unavoidable malfunctions.  Sam got shafted on this one, so give him more of the work on the next one.  The client overpaid on delivery, due to a miscommunication, so go easy on the billables for work after launch.

Some of this was just doing the business dance, so you weren't stepping on others' toes all the time.  But some of it was conscience-motivated.  It was ethical.  It was right, in the circumstances.

Learning to play your part in that process starts out very awkward, like calling out a friend on a bill at a restaurant.  But it's necessary, and it starts to feel normal, quick.  You learn to read a situation, decide which rules work out best for all players, and play by them.  The first time you quote an hourly rate, it sounds like an apology.  The hundredth time, it might as well be your phone number.
