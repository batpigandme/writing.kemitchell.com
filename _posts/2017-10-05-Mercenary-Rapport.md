_A startup selling network surveillance infrastructure to repressive national governments needs a deployment orchestration tool.  Fortunately, they find a promising, MIT-licensed project online.  The project embodies hundreds of hours of volunteer work.  The lead maintainer sports a big EFF sticker on her laptop in the latest conference talk.  She ends her talk with a plea for financial support.  The startup's engineer hiring struggle continues._

_An employee at a large company opens a pull request on a project on a Thursday afternoon.  It takes a six hours of maintainer time, over two weeknights and the weekend, to close.  The request adds a feature of immediate use only to the large company.  The company hires a consultancy to incorporate and deploy the change.  The consultancy bills six hours._

We like to think of open source as inherently exceptional.  We revel in the notion that enterprisey, proprietary, offline-first rules don't apply there.  Some of us came up in open source from the get-go, and never had to learn those rules.  But we have it good, secondhand, that they're a drag, an arbitrary morass of red tape and pointless protocol.  That open source is way better without them.

In more than a few ways, that's absolutely true.  I have seen the enterprise, proprietary software, software companies reenacting the 1990s in the 2010s.  Coming up as an independent contractor, I was never short of material for  a good corporate-dysfunction horror-comedy bit.  And I was quick to point out, to clients and would-be clients, that I could move faster as a mercenary 1099.  That I could get things done, be decisive.  That I could storm process barricades, or simply ignore them, take the flak for deviating from SOP, and leave running code behind.  Somehow, being "an open source guy" got caught up in this image, too.

That's not to say business practices and expectations as a whole didn't apply to what I did.  They absolutely did.  Even if a client hired me on through a friend.  Even if I was subcontract under, or prime contract over, another freelancer with whom I shared code freely.  When the context switched from buddies over Lone Stars to men at work, business expectations, practices, and ethics applied.  Some of that was received wisdom.  But most of us learned and relearned big chunks of it the hard way, by screwing up.

At dinner with friends, nobody really wants to talk about who did or didn't order more than everybody else, and by how much, when the bill comes.  But in business with the very same people, forthrightness about costs and compensation becomes a virtue.  Recognizing the value of others' time is in all enlightened operators' self-interest.  Communication has to be professional, and it ought to be expedient.  All in the service of spreading information around, so that dollars, cents, credits, and benefits stand a fighting chance of reflecting who put what in.

That's the _correct_ outcome.  It was part of every repeat player's job to facilitate that correctness.  It was part of of every repeat player's reputation to adjust, within their discretion, to offset unavoidable malfunctions.  Sam got shafted on this one, so give him more of the work on the next one.  The client overpaid on delivery, due to a miscommunication, so go easy on the billables for work after launch.

Some of this was just doing the business dance, so you weren't stepping on others' toes all the time.  But some of it was conscience-motivated.  It was ethical.  It was right, in the circumstances.

Learning to play your part in that process starts out very awkward, like calling out a friend on a bill at a restaurant.  But it's necessary, and it starts to feel normal, quick.  You learn to read a situation, decide which rules work out best for all players, and play by them.  The first time you quote an hourly rate, it sounds like an apology.  The hundredth time, it might as well be your phone number.
