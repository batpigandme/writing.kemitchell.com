I've created a website, [help.kemitchell.com](https://help.kemitchell.com), listing out ten kinds of help I could most use from others right now.

It was a nice exercise, worthwhile in and of itself.  Of course, I also hope making what I'm after explicit, and public, will help me find it.

Thanks to all of you out there who've already helped and supported me, in so many ways.  I hope each of you feels that you've helped someone trying to do some good in turn.
