Thanks to the encouragement of a few readers, I've [added a link to subscribe by e-mail]({{site.email_subscribe_url}}).  Some folks just prefer to receive things that way.

Right now it just sends me an e-mail, which I'll use to compile the list manually.  No big deal.  In the future, I may automate the process.

Hopefully it goes without saying that I won't be using the list to send anything but blog posts.  Frankly, I have neither the time nor any interest in becoming a growth-hacking marketing maven, and wouldn't sign up for a list by anyone who was.

Folks subscribing to [`/feed.xml`](/feed.xml) and [`/atom.xml`](/atom.xml) won't notice any change.
