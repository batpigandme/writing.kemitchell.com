In general, when drafting contracts from scratch, I try to follow this rule:  Choose defined terms so that every sentence that uses them would still read naturally if they weren't defined.

Since lawyers capitalize defined terms, it's easy to check this rule by changing all letters to lower-case.  Even Microsoft Word will help you do this automatically, and undo the change when you're done.

For example, a piece of language like so...

> Customer agrees to make sure Customer Personnel only share Access Credentials as needed to use the Software and services under these terms.

...should read just fine like so...

> customer agrees to make sure customer personnel only share access credentials as needed to use the software and services under these terms.

Once I have terms with commonly understood meanings that I want to define, I try my best to avoid surprising myself or anyone else in the definitions.  When I fail, I've usually tried to do too much work in the definition, or tried to do in a definition what I should have done elsewhere, in an informative or obligation-creating provision.  So I try to be explicit in my own mind about my goals for each definition:

1.  Do I want to clarify that I use the term in a more specific way than I would in everyday writing?

2.  In a broader way?

3.  Does the term have a few commonly understood meanings that might make sense in context, so I need to point out which meaning I intend?

4.  Am I abusing the definition structure in a bad way for a good reason, such as informing the other side's lawyer, or avoiding the need for customizing changes?

In practice, my definitions often attempt a few of these at once, or blur the lines between them.  A few examples, following on from the sentence above.

> "**Customer Personnel**" means Customerâ€™s employees and each Customer subsidiary's employees, as well as independent contractors providing services to Customer.

- My sense is that this definition makes "Customer Personnel" more specific that I'd mean it in an e-mail or on the phone, by listing particular kinds of personnel, while at the same time broadening it by explicitly covering subsidiaries.  In many contracts, I'd define "subsidiary", perhaps at length.  Here it wasn't worth it.

- I could render the purposes of my definition more transparently by defining more terms, one for each purpose.  Define "Personnel" to reach employees, independent contractors, &c.  Define "Customer" to catch subsidiaries.  That approach would make more language and a longer contract, with more bouncing around between definitions to ferret out all meaning.  I think it would also risk breaking my rule for "Customer", leading me to choose "Customer Group" or the like instead.  I've done exactly that in forms less focused on brevity, where customers were likely to be entity-spanning business groups with fluid structures.

---

> "**Access Credentials**" means a user name and password, license key, or other secret that affords use of the Software.

- The caboose of the list, "other secret", keeps this definition broad.

- At the same time, the definition includes a couple of examples.  That risks limitation.  But that risk was worth taking, since the form uses the generality of this definition to make itself more broadly usable without modification, for software products that use different kinds of credentials.

I rarely come to clear-cut answers when analyzing definitions this way, even definitions that I feel proud of.  But I find asking the question in very structured terms helps me to step off my own train of thought, to spot more errors and inconsistencies of purpose.

Best of all, when it turns out I haven't really any drafting purpose in defining a term at all, or haven't the information or savvy to achieve my purpose with more language, structure stokes my courage to let the define-it-all reflex go.  Very often, the result is specific provisions easier to read, and documents lighter to handle.

Of course, this is all a very technical view on what is never a purely technical endeavor.  Definitions---by definition---add detail.  Detail can resolve disputes, which makes definitions worth drafting, and carefully.  But resolving disputes creates winner and losers, and it's very easy---even natural, I think---for losers to feel a tad cheated whenever a dispute comes down to language tucked away in a definition somewhere.  Especially in a definition in a long list of definitions, especially at the back of the contract, or on its own schedule.

Perhaps there's no getting deescalated-by-a-definition value without slighted-by-a-technicality feelings.  But for what it's worth, it's my experience that before a contract is private law, two sides negotiating terms can usually find and share a common, intuitive, conscience-rooted sense of what's a definition for exactitude, and what's a definition doing too much, or trying to get away with something.  There is something inherently _fair feeling_ about defined terms that pay respect to the common language, start from that shared ground, and make short, transparent steps toward useful exactness.
