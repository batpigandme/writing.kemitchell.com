Open-source licensing veterans of the 1990s and early 2000s share a peculiar vocabulary.  Terms like "use restriction", "attribution", and "provenance" have special meanings in those communities, developed over decades of conference attendance, collaborative work, and mailing list jousting.  Their meanings are neither strictly technical nor accurately legal.  It's not a _secret_ language, by any means.  But it is opaque.  Requests for definitions often evoke more controversy than clarity.

Jargon makes the old hands, and their writing, harder to understand.  I am relatively young blood.  But I am also guilty.  Already.

In my work with open-source clients, and especially in my [public writing](https://writing.kemitchell.com), I've hit upon, and named, communicative concepts that work, and that I'm proud of.  Terms like ["withholding"](https://blog.licensezero.com/2018/03/05/withholding.html), ["tuning"](https://blog.licensezero.com/2017/10/15/unsustainability-at-scale.html), and ["override"](https://oss.kemitchell.com/).

Advising clients with those concepts at the ready is easier and more efficient.  Indeed, many clients come to me _because_ of my public writing, or started reading during our relationship.  Some have even recommended my writing to their customers and communities, via social media and mailing lists.

I've reached a couple of milestones.  I've noticed clients using "kylespeak" in conversations with me, without prompting.  And I've head prospective clients reference "kylespeak" over the phone, even on first-consultation calls.  In a small corner of the Web and the industry, I've affected the language.

That needs to stop.

One of my practice maxims goes:

> It's my job to learn _your_ language, not the other way 'round.

I work to translate my client's goals and views into the system and language of the law.  I don't expect them to serve up goals and views prechewed for legal digestion.  I know how hard it is to learn a language and acculturate in a strange community.  I'm a native speaker of English, and a computer programmer from very young.  But I worked my way into Spanish and Russian.  I worked my way into the law.

[jargon.kemitchell.com](https://jargon.kemitchell.com) will become a living list of the vocabulary I've developed and use in client and broader industry conversations, as well as the cleaner, clearer, plainer alternatives that I should use instead.  This is _not_ a dictionary reference for clients.  This is a plan, _my plan_, and my public commitment, for total eradication of kylespeak, for public and private communication that requires no cheat sheet.  A renewal of my commitment not just to express my best thinking publicly, but to make it as accessible as possible.
