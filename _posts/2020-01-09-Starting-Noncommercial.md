I've been rereading notes and books about the early Internet, free software, and open source.  I'm struck by how many foundational projects began life under licenses that limited commercial use:

- NSFNet's acceptable use policy prohibited "[u]se for for-profit activities" and "[e]xtensive use for private or personal business".

- NSCA Mosaic and Netscape Navigator were free for personal and non-profit use, with commercial licenses for sale

- Linux had a license that included "You may not distribute this for a fee, not even 'handling' costs."

- Ghostscript used the [Aladdin license early on](https://spdx.org/licenses/Aladdin.html)

Think of any more?

I'm pulling together a list [as a reference page](https://reference.kemitchell.com/noncommercial-first.html).
