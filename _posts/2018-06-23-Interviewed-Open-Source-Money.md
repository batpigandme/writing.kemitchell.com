Danny Crichton interviewed me for [a TechCrunch article on open source sustainability](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/23/open-source-sustainability/).  The article quotes me several times, and mentions [License Zero](https://licensezero.com), the company I started to make the dual-licensing business model accessible to independent software developers.

Recently, [the License Zero blog](https://blog.licensezero.com) has been home for my writing on open source funding.  I've expressed repeated concern there about software that "abstracts" open source developers away, making them invisible to those who rely on them, and should be rewarding or at least supporting their work.

I was thrilled to see that concern reflected, and eloquently expressed, in Danny's independent analysis.
