I will be giving a talk entitled [_Is this conference a good idea?_](https://opencoresummit2019.sched.com/event/UN6V/is-this-conference-a-good-idea-kyle-e-mitchell-independent-attorney) at the [Open Core Summit](https://opencoresummit.com) in San Francisco next week.

Tickets are prohibitively expensive, at [$1,000](https://opencoresummit.com/tickets), a fact not lost on my choice of title.  I don't yet know if the conf will provide A/V for video, but I'll bring a small audio recorder myself, at a minimum.
