Thanks to [Heather Meeker](https://heathermeeker.com/), I've finally got around to publishing my go-to copyright policy for website operators who want the protection of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's from copyright liability as a set of [springboard terms](/2020/05/13/Springboard-Agreement.html):

You can [read the first draft of a first edition of DMSimple online](https://commonform.org/kemitchell/dmsimple/1e2d).  I've also published [a template showing how a website can use the terms](https://commonform.org/kemitchell/dmsimple-template/1e1d).

The vast majority of DMCA/copyright policies say the same thing.  At best, they merely say what we expect and duplicate the contact information [from the copyright office's agent directory](https://www.copyright.gov/dmca-directory/).  We post them because the law requires us to.
