As [gamesindustry.biz reports](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-03-23-nintendo-presses-sony-to-remove-mario-creations-from-dreams), Nintendo, maker of the Mario video games, has got Mario-themed content removed from Dreams, a Sony game that gives players a ready-made toolkit to build games and other interactive experiences of their own, for themselves and other Dreams players.

The original piece mentioned a particular work removed without any notice to the originating user.  But an update to the gamesindustry.biz piece reports that action was taken in response to "an IP Infringement Notice".  I tentatively infer that Nintendo eventually leveraged the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's takedown process.

Anecdotally, a noticeable chunk of the early community-generated content generating buzz in the first weeks after Dreams' launch boiled down to more or less amateurish renditions of existing video game properties, like Sonic the Hedgehog.

Fascinating.
