This short guide distills some of the lessons I've learned participating in, facilitating, publishing, and leading standardized legal terms projects. You can see a list of my projects [here](https://projects.kemitchell.com).

## Start by picking a name.
{: #name}

You need to come up with a name for your project.  Talking about your project, and getting others to talk about your project, will be hard or impossible without one.  Folks need a name for to-do list items.  They need a name for organizing e-mails.  They need a name for message subject lines.  They need a name just to remember to think about your project.  If it doesn't have a name, it's not really a project yet.

Ideally, you'll pick a name at the start and stick with it forevermore.  Do as much as you can to come up with many possible names, compare them, check for potential conflicts.  Research prior projects and companies with similar names online.  Make sure that domain names, trademarks, social media handles, and the rest are available.

Changing names over time isn't ideal, but early on, it's perfectly doable.  [The Waypoint NDA](https://waypointnda.com) was originally called "The Canting Tribe NDA".  The funky name wasn't great, but it was fun for the small group involved.  If we'd held work up, waiting for a better name early on, Waypoint as we know it now wouldn't exist.

## Grab domain names and social media handles immediately.
{: #domain}

Registering domain names and social media accounts is cheap or free.  It's no big commitment to secure them, and doing so can serve an early warning about potential conflicts that could affect a trademark application later.

Launch the simplest website you can.  All the information should fit on one page.

## Give potential contributors a starting point.
{: #start}

Projects that attempt to work up first drafts by committee usually fail before producing any complete draft.  It takes a single motivated individual, or maybe a tight group of two or three, to overcome inertia and produce a starting point.

Once you have a complete starting point, colleagues with less time or interest become able to contribute with less commitment.  As they see their contributions incorporated and appreciated, their motivation to contribute in bigger ways can grow.

## Banish pride of authorship.
{: #pride}

Having produced a complete starting point for others to work from, take explicit, repeated, public action to reassure potential contributors that whoever has the motivation "has the pen".  Welcome changes from small to sweeping.

Communicating an expectation of "throwing the first one away" can go a long way.  So can seemingly mundane choices like taking names off the draft, publishing on accounts and websites under the project's name rather than your own, and ensuring that everyone invited to access the draft has full powers to edit and comment on every part of it.

## Double down on a small core team.
{: #core}

When it comes to early collaborators, quality and collegiality take precedence.  Quantity will probably hurt the project.

Two or three lawyers contributing meaningfully once or twice a week can get a ton of great work done.  At this stage, the work you need done largely boils down to settling on a name, getting a version 1.0 out the door, and attracting more active collaborators one or two at a time.

If people flock to the idea of your project, expressing enthusiasm but not stepping up to refine the substance, consider creating a mailing list or other communications channel where they can sit and wait.  You may go weeks or months without sending or receiving any message through that channel.  That's fine.  When the time comes, it will be easy to reach out to the group en masse and find out whose enthusiasm survived the initial burst of novelty.

## Publish 1.0 as soon as possible.
{: #1.0}

Overcome anxiety about publishing a version as ready for public use.  You will be tempted to describe everything as a "draft" or to adopt bashful conventions like "version 0.10".  Don't.  As soon as you are ready to recommend the work for client use, call that 1.0 and publish it.  Expect to publish a 2.0, or even a 7.0 or 17.0, later.

Potential contributors know about publication anxiety.  Those on the fence---interested but not actively engaged---will be on the lookout for a signal of viability and momentum before committing, consciously or unconsciously.  Don't waste their time with a shoddy sketch of useful terms.  But don't send them signals to keep waiting when it's time to step up.

## Register a trademark just before publishing 1.0.
{: #trademark}

A US trademark applications costs a little less than $300.  You want to put that cost off until you know it's worthwhile.  Which is mostly a question of whether the name "sticks" with the core team.
