Philosophically, free and open source licensing means non-discrimination.  Practically, open source licensing discriminates all the time, particularly in favor of those with exclusive rights that open source intentionally chooses not to account for.  Adding open source to a stacked-deck game often further skews the odds in the dealer's favor, by denying strong cards to others in the game. 

Companies making money on open source, or scoring strategic business victories through it, charge for something other than licenses.  Those making good money have some bulwark---an exclusive right---against competitors who would happily earn less to take a piece of that action.

Open source is very conscious of well know, law-based kinds of exclusive rights: copyrights, or exclusive rights in creative work, patents, or exclusive rights in useful inventions, and trademarks, exclusive rights in names that identify products and services with their providers.  Open source was initially laser-focused on copyright, expanded to address patent as it could, and acknowledges trademark, usually to [leave it as-is](https://zoo.kemitchell.com/Apache-2.0#trademarks), sometimes to [emulate it by means of copyright conditions](https://spdx.org/licenses/Zlib.html).

Open source theory remains willfully blind to exclusive rights outside intellectual property.

For example, in some industries, companies require government approvals, regulatory licenses, or private certifications to do business.  Those rights often apply only to the specific company that obtains them, rather than to its software more generally, and cover organizational as well as technical criteria.  When those rights prove prohibitively expensive or simply impractical for anyone else to obtain, they become effectively exclusive.

Companies holding those exclusive rights can freely release their software as open source.  They hold a greater power---an effectively exclusive right to do business with that software---that makes the lesser power of licensing irrelevant.  Having released as open source, developers can leverage free infrastructure, like code hosting, testing, and distribution.  Contributions may even come back from outside the firm.  But other contributors aren't free to operationalize or commercialize the results.  Overall, the system discriminates against them.  But the software is "open source", because open source chooses not to see that discrimination.

Exclusive rights may be even less formal, based not in law, but in market circumstances.  Some firms dominate whole commercial categories due to overwhelming brand recognition, entrenched or exclusive relationships, or market power, manifest as cartel or monopoly control.  These firms effectively occupy swathes of customer brain space in the addressable market, as vendors occupy booth spaces on a trade-show floor.  Even if a competitor has every right needed to offer a competing product or service, they may be totally unable to make it known or sell it.

When business theorists speak of "network effects", they mean rights that are not only exclusive, but compounding.  They speak of an antidote to, or protection from, competition.

Software companies benefiting from strong network effects are prolific sources of open source software.  They can be, having graduated to a level of competitive advantage that makes copyright and perhaps even patent---the whole blinkered view of open source---not just redundant, but needlessly complicating.

Consider Kubernetes.  Perhaps it's good technology, a true step change from what came before.  It's certainly well promoted that way.  So much so that a great number of those enthusiastically riding this new wave of the orchestrated future have clearly no need for its complexity, given their size and use cases.  But the name recognition and technical reputation of Google, the massive budget Google has thrust behind it, and the dynamics of new-hotness in software engineering all conspire to make Kubernetes an industry force.  There is apparently nothing Amazon, a behemoth in other forms of customer attention, can do about it.

That was utterly calculated.  Google pushes Kubernetes to crack open the market dominance of Amazon Web Services.  [Here's their man saying so in a public conference talk, complete with heartfelt assurance that wearing the motive on their sleeve was key to their success.](https://youtu.be/L7WKHLpm4wc?t=156)

These are the lumbering, lumbering blows of tech titans, wielding budgets and strategic heavy weapons smaller firms can't lift.  What about the little guys?  What tools could they possibly have with which to compete?

There is one universal exclusive right in software: creators of software have the right to share it, or to keep it secret.  This is the cornerstone of the "source" part of "open source".  Merely granting the right license for some lesser form---say, obfuscated source or compiled binary---or granting a license for software the licensed can't actually find doesn't count.

Copyright is only slightly less universal.  Under US law, copyright applies to nearly any code, so long as it evidences some degree of creativity.  There's no need to file any application, or pay any fee, to receive exclusive copyright, at least until you need to sue.
