title: Revoke Permissive Licenses
layout: post

This is a post in a series, _Killjoy's Guide to Open Source_, where I'll examine unorthodox, unwelcome solutions to nagging open source problems.

Users of software licensed under dated permissive terms like MIT and BSD don't pay or promise anything in return.  Under US law, both for contracts and for licenses, people aren't typically bound to terms they give away for nothing.  In many cases, developers of MIT and BSD software may be able to _revoke_, or take back, licenses to specific users who should support them, but ignore or refuse to do so, and force negotiations for a paid license.

John Q. Programmer releases a library called PowerLib under the two-clause BSD license.  Big A Company starts using PowerLib in their proprietary software-as-a-service application.  John learns that Big A Company is using PowerLib.  John asks Big A Company for financial support.  Big A Company ignores him.  John sends Big A Company a legal notice _revoking_ his license for PowerLib to Big A Company:

    Big A Company
    Attention: Legal Department
    baclegal@example.com
    123 Some Street
    Somewhere, SW 12345
    USA

    To Whom It May Concern:

    I hereby revoke the license I granted for PowerLib
    under the terms of the two-clause BSD license, as it
    applies Big A Company and its personnel, effective
    September 20, 2018.

    If Big A Company wishes to continue using PowerLib,
    please contact me about a private license.  I would
    be willing to grant Big A Company a license for a
    reasonable annual fee.

    Regards,

    John Q. Programmer
