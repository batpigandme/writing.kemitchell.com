Plain language makes even more sense in corporate business than in consumer contracts.

From the client's point of view, every deals lawyer is an idiot.  Lawyers don't know shit about business.  The particular lawyer doesn't know shit about _the client's_ business.  They're hopeless.  But they have the legal knowledge.
