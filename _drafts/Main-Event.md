And here we have it, ladies and gentlemen---the main event!

In one corner, [Amazon Web Services](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/technology/amazon-aws-cloud-competition.html), weighing in at Way More Money Than Print Can Accurately Convey and boasting more corporate communications writer people than the Washington Post has journalists.

In the opposite corner, [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/technology/amazon-aws-cloud-competition.html), American's mostest or leastest favorite newspaper, depending on whether you read the New York Times, boasting people who actually pay to read its content online in 2019.

The bell rings.  They saunter to the center.  Glistening and shaking, they trade their blows:

--- Preferencing its own products!

--- Plentiful partnerships!

--- Strip-mining open source!

--- Customer-focused!

--- Pull quotes and photo portraits!

--- Tweetstorms and unnamed analysts!

And slowly, inexorably, it dawns on the crowd at bout assembled.  The contenders weigh heavy indeed.  But neither has the publicity punch to knock the other down.  Maybe to knock _anyone_ down.

We could watch them huff and puff their way through twelve rounds and a few thousand words.  We could tally up the points.  We could even declare a winner, by well reasoned decision.  But there's no new narrative to note.  No rhetorical route to recant.  Not so much as a good, clean zinger to savor.

The titans have met, and they got nothin'.  It's one for the stats, not one for the history books.

For the partisans of either camp reading here, a few point-by-points follow, obligatorily.  Not that they'll shake any minds, but a fool has to try.

Then some thoughts on what this all means, or, rather, what it doesn't, the lack of meaning at stake in general, and how that's the point.

## Strip Mining

"Strip-mining open source" is highly accurate.  Miners strip for minerals near the surface, not at great depth.  It takes enormous machines and vast economy of scale.  It purges the ecology, scars the landscape, and disrupts local communities.

Delectable nuance.  But nuance is for bookish saps and literary suckers.  Saps and suckers like me.

For the rest of humanity, "strip-mining open source" is highly inaccurate.  Strip mining is legal, albeit regulated.  It is also productive.  We look askance at coal now, when we remember to think about it.  But it wasn't so long ago that my progenitors had to clock in for their anthracite coughs down a deep, dark shaft somewhere.

But there aren't any miners here.  We're talking about people, largely educated, affluent people, who twiddle smooth fingers on plastic and stare at pretty screens all day.  If they skew hippie and croon community Kumbaya, there's no great sympathy waiting when they fail to become rich.  If you take the off-ramp toward the commune, don't complain when there's no executive suite there waiting for you.  Stop being the guy who pays all the tabs and then hurts for money.

Taking your stuff isn't wrong if you said they could, and you knew they would, because America.

## Customer-Centric

"Customer-centric" is demonstrably true.  AWS apparently loves doing what AWS customers say they will pay AWS for.  Of course, none of said customers purportedly asked for AWS.  But now that they have it, it's the cruel yoke of input-validated product-market fit unto death, come Hell or high regulatory exposure.

But "customer-centric" is manifold lame.  Nobody outside the corporate envelope---the _Amazon_ corporate envelope---cares about pat internal business pablum.  You kinda have to be there, repeatedly, at some form of meeting, likely mandatory, for a slogan like that to resonate in any deep well of experience.  The correct pronunciation is obviously "AWS-customer-centric".  The "AWS" is implied.  Which is the problem.

For after all, American corporate mission mumbo is like the fresh flesh of a ripe Cali 'cado: it goes brown and slimy on exposure to any outside atmosphere.  The firm rhetorical bite and vibrant vocal color retains only with a thorough surface acid barrier of satire.  Extemp:

> customer-centrism, n.
>
> The theory or belief that everyone is an Amazon customer and that Amazon is therefore situated at the center of the universe.
>
> See Also: Bezomaic System

See what I mean?

There's nothing romantic or inspiring about grubbing for purchase orders.  That's called work.

## Open Source

The upshot here is that there's nothing left.  The reason we're here, the reason there's a bout to begin with, is a little term called "open source" from the dawn of the current era.  It is now old enough to drink.

Notwithstanding the money that is and will be coursing through the computer economy's veins for all the foreseeable future, the heady, intoxicating essence of "open source" as computer-cultural mythos has run dry.  The major players are positioned to fight for scraps, well past all boundless-plenty-awaits mentality.

Open source has been around too long, explicitly and implicitly promising too much to too many, not too engender real and inevitable disappointment.  It's the New Beetle open source era, baby.  The dream was alive, and lo, the cash did flow.  If you didn't get yours, the market says you didn't deserve it.

There will be no winner in the case of Amazon v. Everyone in the bout for the open source championship.  Just a more broadly disseminated and marginally accelerated sense that the quest is played out.

There won't be any great battle, either.  The generals with heavy weapons at their command aren't coming down from a heady bender of 2000s Internet exceptionalism.  They're way past that.
