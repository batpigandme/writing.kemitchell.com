_Open source_ is one of those marvelous, vacuous phrases, like _freedom_ and _maturity_, with so many meanings nobody knows what it means, and such an overwhelmingly positive vibe that everyone ought to suspect it.  Open source is an idealistic political movement.  Or fast-acting lawyer repellent.  Or a development methodology.  Or a community.  A right to self-help.  A right to help from others.  The most modern form of philanthropy.  The craftiest business model.

All of those things sound great.  Which is why open source rides so high.  But they can't be all true all the time.

When we want something from open source, or from other people, under cover of open source, we summon the theory that supports our claim in the moment.  In other words, we _arbitrage_ definitions of open source.  When I want help with open source for my business, open source means the hobbyist maintainer ought to help me.  When someone else wants free work for their hobby, open source means they should help themself, and be grateful my company chose to afford the rights and means.  When I'm irked by a GPL license, open source means they ought to relicense MIT.  When I'm irked by WTFPL, open source means they ought to be GPL.  And so on, a thousand different ways.

Inconsistent?  Hardly.  Arbitrage gets us the most of what we want, every time we find ourselves wanting.  High-volume, narrow-bandwidth, gameified interactions train us to do excel at it, consciously or unconsciously.

One or another meaning of _open source_ prevails in each expedient moment.  But some trends in circumstances _around_ open source elevate some meanings over others, in the run of interactions, at any given time.  No meaning of open source matters more, in present context, than open source as _passport to corporate procurement_. 

Industry has largely accepted open source. As it turns out, industry and its money mean a lot more than older concepts that motivated open source when it when industry saw open source as the enemy.

Companies either have a lot of money or want a lot of money.  That means playing defense.  Managers set up all manner of controls around the business and legal terms their companies accept.  Net result, selling software into a large- or even medium-sized company frequently takes dedicated marketers, salespeople, lawyers, and managers a few months.

In the past, open source software had to travel through corporate procurement.  Procurement rigor even without payment isn't unusual.  It happens all the time for free trials of proprietary products.  But in time, companies began to set up parallel, independent open source approval processes.  At simplest, company policies permit any open source software licensed under a blessed list of preapproved terms.  Other policies require manual review, for patent or other risk.
