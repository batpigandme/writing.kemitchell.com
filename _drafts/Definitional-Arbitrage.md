_Open source_ is one of those marvelous, vacuous phrases, like _freedom_ and _maturity_, with so many meanings that nobody knows what they mean, and such a positive connotation anyway that everybody ought to be wary.  Open source is an idealistic political movement.  Or utilitarian lawyer repellent.  Or a development methodology.  Or a community.  A right to self-help.  A right to help from others.  The most modern form of charity.  A crafty business model.

When we want something from open source, or from other people, under cover of open source, we summon the meaning that supports our claim.  When I want support, open source means the developer ought to give it to me.  When someone else wants free work, open source means they should help themself.  When I'm irked by a GPL license, open source means they ought to relicense MIT.  When I'm irked by WTFPL, open source means they ought to be GPL-compatible.  And so on, a thousand different ways.

We arbitrage meanings of _open source_.  We lean toward the meaning, in each moment, that serves us best.  We do it naturally, instinctually,  without a thought.  Hypocritical?  Hogwash.  No approach matches its consistently.  Arbitrage gets us the most of what we want, every time we find ourselves wanting.  Online interaction trains us to trade.

But some meanings matter more, when self-image meets reality.  Practically speaking, no meaning of _open source_ matters more than than _free pass through corporate procurement_.  In other words, industry adoption.

Companies either have a lot of money, or want a lot of money.  That means playing defense.  Just as individuals spend themselves into trouble far easier with credit cards than cash, companies drain their coffers quicker making promises and taking debt than paying purchase orders.

Knowing this, managers set up all manner of controls around the business and legal terms their companies accept.  They are as careful about the terms they accept for others' products and services as the terms they offer for their own.  Net result, selling software into a company frequently takes dedicated marketers, salespeople, lawyers, and managers months.
