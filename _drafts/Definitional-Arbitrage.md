_Open source_ is one of those marvelous, vacuous phrases, like _freedom_ or _maturity_, with so many meanings we can't ever really be sure what it means, and such a positive sheen that we can't possibly take it too seriously.  Open source is an idealistic political movement.  Pragmatic lawyer repellent.  A kind of license.  A kind of process.  A development methodology.  A community.  A right to self-help.  A right to help from others.  The most modern form of philanthropy.  The cutting-edge business model of tomorrow.

All of those sound great.  Which is why open source rides so high.  But they can't all be true, for all involved, all the time.  They're abstractions---happy ones---and they leak all over each other.

As a result, to talk about open source consistently is also to talk about open source selectively.  And to get things done in open source is to be choosy about the stories of open source we tell, to support our claims in the moment.  We _arbitrage_ theories of open source.  When I want help with software for my business, open source means the hobbyist maintainer ought to help me.  When someone else wants free work for their hobby project, open source means they should help themself, and be grateful my company chose to afford the rights and means.  When I'm irked by a GPL license, open source means moving on from old Free Software dogma, and relicensing Apache 2.0.  When MIT fails to protect me downstream, open source means it ought to be GPL.

Inconsistent?  Hardly.  We tend to drag out exactly the tropes that describe our own experiences best.  And of course arbitrage gets us the most of what we want, every time.  High-volume, narrow-bandwidth, gameified interactions train us in the practice, whether we consciously adopt it or not.

Nobody can see the whole open source community.  Nobody experiences open source every possible way.  We all look for stories that validate and support us.  That is how movements get big enough to move things.  But movements themselves get moved.

# Access Pass

Every compelling story of open source describes, and matters to, somebody.  But some good stories of open source are more good than others.  Values rise and fall with circumstances outside of open source, in the surrounding environment.

Currently, no meaning of open source works more influence on those I advise, be they pious idealists or hard-nosed entrepreneurs, than open source as _free pass through corporate procurement_.  If it's open source, I can probably get it into my company.  If I make it open source, I can probably get it into _your_ company.  The deeper open source penetrates industry, the more open source's value reflects the value of access to industry attention and capital.  The more open source, as a vehicle, takes you closer to the money.

But of corporate coffers don't pop open at first mention of "open source", of course.  Firms know that what they have makes them targets, from within and without.  So managers set up all manner of defensive controls around the business and legal terms their companies accept.  _Procurement_ is the process of running those gauntlets.  Net effect, selling software into even a medium-sized company often takes a combined marketing, sales, legal, management, and internal-champion team months.  It's often just as challenging for the person _inside_ the enterprise, who wants to buy the thing, as for the folks on the other side, with the vendor, who want to sell it.  

In the past, open source software had to endure pretty much the same ordeal as anything else with legal terms.  Lack of fees didn't matter.  Legal terms can _obligate_ companies to pay, which can be a whole lot worse.  To this day, free trials of proprietary software products go through procurement processes.  But in time, facing pressure both internally, from engineers, and externally, from vendors, companies began to set up parallel open source approval processes.

At simplest, open source policies permit fast-track procurement of open source software under licenses on an approved list.  Engineers can often bring such code in themselves, with compliance checks at intervals or release points, rather than before they download.  Typically, no lawyers, sales people, or even managers may be involved, day-to-day.  A free pass.

# Loss Lead-Me-In

Utter lack of payment for the right to use open source software is what you might call a _major business limitation_.  Getting paid is what business does, or it isn't business.  But a mere foot in the door at a large enterprise is worth something, as a successful free trial of a proprietary product is worth something.  You've validated interest.  You've proved a concept.  You've demonstrated a use case.  You have someone's attention.  People and processes within the customer's organization have begun to expect, maybe even rely upon, your software.  Your hook is set.  Business spends all kinds of booze, beef, and ballgame money for that kind of thing.

In traditional, proprietary software procurement, trial success means it's contract time: long-term license, plus the largest helpings of integration, configuration, support, maintenance, training, more software, and anything else that you can sell.  Permissively licensed open source software forgoes just one of sliver of that opportunity: the paid license for the software they already have.  You'll have to go through procurement for the rest.  But you didn't have to go through procurement for the trial.  In fact, when someone tries your open source software and decides not to go forward, you may not spend any time on them at all.  The opportunities you  _do_ hear about tend to be the cream.

We often think of open source as a loss leader.  Eat the cost of putting the product out.  Forgo income from self-sufficient users and maybe even competitor-vendors.  All to sow a broader field, where other opportunity can grow.  But open source can also act as a loss leader _within_ bigco procurement.  The field is known: companies big enough to spend enterprise money on you.  At the cost of slightly reduced paid-deal scope---no license fees for the open source product---you can run an efficient sales program addressing the whole market, with a skeleton crew, maybe even by yourself.  The missing license-fee line item might be a pittance.

# Flow-Through

This dynamic affects not only those selling to enterprises, but those selling to those selling to enterprises, and, more broadly, anyone trying to get their software into organizations with real or aspirational enterprise taste in software.  Startups play fast and loose to start, but see the compliance reckoning coming from a mile away, as financing or acquisition due diligence.  Active value added resellers and consultancies spend most of a year in at least _somebody's_ procurement process, and know better than to bring unnecessary problems in with them.  Big company employees canvass the land of open source, telling the stories of open source that encourage making work available to them.

Open source has reached out and touched a great many companies who never saw it coming, and didn't know they were interested.  In this, we say, "open source won".  But as industry and open source have fused together, industry's concerns have percolated open source.  Not just in a preference for MIT over GPL.  In the volume and frequency with which the open story gets told form the corporate-consumer point of view.

# Inversion

Open source was the blood enemy of industry.  Open source products _competed_ with proprietary alternatives.  Now industry has largely accepted open source.  Open source serves largely as a performance-enhancer for firms writing proprietary code.

Turns out, industry and its money mean a lot more, to more people, than the niche causes and peculiar ideology of the academic, hobbyist, anti-establishment era.
