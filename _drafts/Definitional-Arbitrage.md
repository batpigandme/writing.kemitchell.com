_Open source_ is one of those marvelous, vacuous phrases, like _freedom_ and _maturity_, with so many meanings nobody knows what it means, and such a uniformly positive vibe that we all ought to suspect anyone using it seriously.  Open source is an idealistic political movement.  Or canned lawyer repellent.  Or a development methodology.  Or a community.  A right to self-help.  A right to help from others.  The most modern form of philanthropy.  A crafty business model.

All of those things are great.  Which is why open source rides so high.  But they can't all be true, or all good, for all involved, all the time.

When we want something from open source, or from other people under cover of open source, we summon the meaning of open source that supports our claim in the moment.  In other words, we _arbitrage_ models of open source.  When I want help with software for my business, open source means the hobbyist maintainer should help me.  When someone else wants free work for their hobby project, open source means they should help themself, and be grateful my company chose to afford the rights and means.  When I'm irked by a GPL license, open source means they ought to relicense MIT.  When I'm irked by WTFPL, open source means they ought to be GPL.  And so on, a thousand different ways.

Inconsistent?  Hardly.  Arbitrage gets us the most of what we want, every time.  High-volume, narrow-bandwidth, gameified interactions train us to excel at it, whether we set out to or not.  We learn just by showing up in the working environment.

As a result, meanings of open source rise and fall, as they reflect other, extrinsic factors.  Trends in circumstances _around_ open source raise some meanings over others, in the run of interactions, at any given time.  No meaning of open source matters more today, person for person, dollar for dollar, than open source as _free pass through corporate procurement_.

Selling software into a large- or even medium-sized company often takes a combined marketing, sales, legal, and management team a few months.  Companies either have a lot of money or want a lot of money.   To defend their troves, managers set up all manner of controls around the business and legal terms their companies accept.  Procurement is the process of running that gauntlet.  It's often just as challenging for the person _inside_ the enterprise that wants to buy the thing as the folks on the other side, with the vendor, who want to sell it.

In the past, open source software had to suffer pretty much the same ordeal as anything else with legal terms.  Even today, procurement rigor without payment of any kind is normal, including for free trials of proprietary products.  But in time, facing pressure both internally, from engineers, and externally, from vendors, companies began to set up parallel open source approval processes.  At simplest, these policies permit fast-track procurement of open source software licensed under terms on a preapproved list.  Often engineers themselves do the procuring, with compliance checks at intervals or release points, rather than waiting for procurement officers to approve code as it comes in.  In the usual case, no lawyers, sales people, or even managers may be involved, day-to-day.  There is only marketing, to tell the engineer what they want it in the first place.

Of course, there isn't any payment either.  But mere entry into a large enterprise is often worth something, in much the same way that a successful free trial for a proprietary product is worth something.  You've validated interest.  You've proved a concept.  You've demonstrated a use case.  People and processes within the customer's organization have begun to expect, maybe even rely on, your software.  You've set a hook.

In traditional, proprietary software procurement, that hook means it's time to talk long-term, paid license, plus a hearty helping of combination, integration, configuration, support, maintenance, training, more software, and whatever else you can sell.  Permissively licensed open source forgoes just one of those opportunities: the paid license for the original software.  You'll have to go through procurement for the rest, but a deal you can get.

We often think of open source releases as loss leaders.  Eat the cost of putting the product out there, in order to sow a broader market.  But open source release also works in this more narrow way: It fast-forwards you to free trials in large enterprises.

Open source was the blood enemy of industry.  Now industry has largely accepted open source.  Turns out, industry and its money mean a lot more, to more people, than the old motivations driving open source before open source and industry fused.
