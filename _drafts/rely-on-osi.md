Hackers and companies can rely on the Open Source Initiative in myriad ways.  Many are valid and wise, especially in the policy realm, where institutions can go where individuals can't, especially nonprofits.  But relying on Open Source Initiative license approval for practical effect is almost never wise.

I am a lawyer.  I help clients draft contracts, policies, and other operative terms all the time.  These days, more often than not, those terms deal with open source software.  What licenses will the developer apply to their work under contract?  What licenses can they accept for the work of others they use on the job?  What kinds of projects will a service allow, or allow for free?

Every time I have written OSI license approval into those kinds of terms, I've come to regret it.  And I've been paid by several clients to make others regret the same kinds of terms.

Unless your purpose is to track OSI's political history, to ride on its social capital, or to bolster its esteem, rather than your own interests, don't define "open source" by OSI approval, and don't rely on those approvals for functional consistency or completeness.  OSI's process of accumulating approvals over time was not driver by technical consistency, but political expedience.  The license list does not reflect technical consistency by happy accident.

I have criticized the Open Source Definition and the way the Open Source Initiative claims to apply it.  I am not criticizing those here.  Rather, I draw attention to a fundamental mismatch of needs and function in practice, rather than any kind of inherent flaw.  Relying on the OSI license list to approve or disapprove of licenses, for legal effect, is a misapplication and a bodge.  In nearly any practical context, the set of OSI-approved licenses will include licenses that you want to exclude, and omit licenses that you want.
