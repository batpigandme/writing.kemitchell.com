Hackers and companies can rely on the Open Source Initiative in myriad ways.  Many are valid and wise, especially in the policy realm, where institutions can go where individuals can't, and nonprofit neutrality holds sway.  But relying on Open Source Initiative license approval for practical effect is almost never wise.

I am a lawyer.  I help clients draft contracts, policies, and other operative terms all the time.  These days, more often than not, those terms deal directly with open source licenses.  What licenses will the developer apply to their work under contract?  What licenses can they accept for the work of others they use on the job?  What kinds of projects will a service allow, or allow for free?

Every time I have written OSI license approval into those kinds of terms, I've come to regret it.  And I've been paid by several clients to make others regret the same kinds of terms.  Unless your purpose is to track OSI's political history, to ride on its social capital, or to bolster its esteem, rather than your own interests, don't define "open source" by OSI approval, and don't rely on its approvals for functional consistency or completeness.  Those were not primary motivations in its approvals over time, and they are not reflected in the license list by happy accident.

I have criticized the Open Source Definition and the way the Open Source Initiative claims to apply it.  I am not criticizing them here.  I draw attention to a fundamental mismatch of needs and function, rather than any kind of flaw.  Relying on the OSI license list to approve or disapprove of licenses, for legal effect, is a misapplication and a bodge.  In nearly any practical context, the set of OSI-approved licenses will include licenses that you want to exclude, and omit licenses that you want.

From the many conversations flowing out of [#wontfix](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/04/23/OSD-wontfix.html), one point keeps sticking in my mind: the idea that the "community", however defined, relies on the Open Source Initiative.  In the past, I've challenged those claims directly.  Of late, I've changed my tack.  I ask for more detail, and strain to listen, rather than to speak.  _How_ do people rely on OSI?

Now I am ready to speak.

I think there are perfectly valid ways to rely on the Open Source Initiative.  Rely on it to represent your goals and views, if they align.  Rely on it to represent your sensibilities in forums where institutions have a seat, but individuals do not.
