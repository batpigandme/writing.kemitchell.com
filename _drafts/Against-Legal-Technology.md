Do lawyers need legal technology?

Apparently not.

The most important software for my line of lawyering---commercial deals work---differs little from the most important software for anyone else who writes for others.  E-mail.  Address book.  Word processor.  File manager.  Shared folder.  Web browser.

None of these utilities exist specifically for lawyers.  None of them boast a "lawyer mode" catering to legal needs.  Vendors offer add-ons, but the utilities support a lot of customization out of the box.  When lawyers do use add-ons or customizations, they don't expect others to do the same.  Many of us don't even use styles or automatic numbering in Word files.  Two less steps closer to a reliable lowest common denominator.
