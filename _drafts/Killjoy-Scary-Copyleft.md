This is one of a series, [_Killjoy_](/series/Killjoy.html), in which I sketch unorthodox and unwelcome solutions to nagging open source problems.

GPL isn't scary anymore.  That's why it isn't working.

In the 1990s and 2000s, competing, coordinated efforts sought to both oversell and downplay the threat of GPL and other copyleft licenses to business as usual.  GPL was "viral".   Or that was nonsense.  If your engineers cribbed the wrong code, your whole company had to go open source.   Or it didn't, and everything would be fine.  GPL was communism.  GPL protected your freedom.

In the end, team "sleep sound" prevailed over team "be very afraid".  The words "GPL is a viral license" retain a very 2001 ring to them.  But for those ready to see, we find ample evidence of overcorrection.  As usual, battling it out from two self-interested extremes didn't yield harmonious balance.

GPL violation runs rampant.  I've heard engineers estimate that the average Best Buy stocks a handful of devices running Linux, the killer GPL project, with no source code to be had.  And on the industry, side, doing open source licensing in a nutshell spiel over and over again, a question keeps coming from the back of the room:

> Thanks for making all this complex license stuff simpler.  But on the copyleft side, really, what's the risk of enforcement here?  If I break the GPL, is anybody really going to come after us?  What are the real consequences?

Frankly, the risk is very low.  As a general rule, unless the copyleft code you're using comes from a company or a strong-willed hacker with legal experience, you're unlikely to face any meaningful consequences at all.  And certainly not on the kinds of time scales---at most, a few years---that correspond to personal accountability in the business environment.

How so?

For one, enforcing licenses for published code can't be easy.  Possession is nine tenths of the law, and publication is nine tenths of open source.  Publishing code online gives everyone possession.  Licensors have to find out that someone's using their code without following their rules before they even realize they need to make a decision about how to handle it.  Alas, nothing about open source distribution requires this information be reported back to licensors.  Some organizations invest in monitoring and enforcement, but many more simply release without any thought, or budget, for the consequences.

Meanwhile, several well known foundations stewarding big-name projects are falling over themselves to publicly and accountably tie their own hands in license enforcement.  The ["Principles of Community-Oriented GPL Enforcement"](https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/principles.html) boil down to a list of _restrictions_ on what GPL enforcers can do.  They are, in effect, elective exceptions to the GPL's terms, weakening the leverage of the licensor against violators.  The ["GPL Cooperation Commitment"](https://gplcc.github.io/gplcc/) amends GPLv2 explicitly, "backporting" a section of GPLv3 that excuses violators into GPLv2, with like effect.  The same organizations often follow formal or unwritten policies that prescribe conciliatory, nonconfrontational, gunshy enforcement, even when the violators are dead to rights for infringement.

Overall, one gathers that the "community" institutions either regret the ongoing existence of copyleft, and would prefer to relicense under functionally permissive terms if only they could, or else worry more about charges of lost purity, prestige, or self-righteousness against their enforcement processes than charges that those enforcement processes aren't effective.  Reading from the timeline, all of the mitigations mentioned above follow closely behind the legal debut of Patrick McHardy.  It's difficult to tell exactly what McHardy's been up to, due to the language and confidentiality barriers of the German legal system.  But the crux seems to be that he enforced his GPL license for contributions to the Linux kernel against GPL violators for cash settlements.  Those looking to calm industry have fallen over themselves to coin new pejoratives for this practice: "copyright trolling", "copyright profiteering", and so on.  As far as I'm aware, no other widespread enforcement effort has been so broadly remarked, because no other widespread enforcement effort has been so effective.

Eben Moglen, late of FSF, now of Software Freedom Law Center, publicly argued that those who would enforce the GPL and other copyleft licenses can't achieve their goals by enforcement alone.  Potential violators far outnumber potential license enforcers, and violations aren't easy or cheap to detect, attack, and resolve.  To succeed, therefore, licensors must convince licensees to police themselves.

But wholly soft-hands enforcement fails to account for all sides of human nature, not to mention the strange nature of large firms.  When someone rear ends our car at low speed, or breaks a headlight with a shopping cart in a parking lot, it is one thing to be nice about it, and quite another to let them off.  If what we need and want is mostly to feel good about our own valor and piety, perhaps letting them off with a lecture takes the cake.  But if what we need or want is compensation, or further reassurance that collective behavior will honor our rights, some blend of hard and soft does the most good.

Some people will mind the GPL's rules, even when nobody else is watching, because they've heard the message and believed.  Maybe that was the message of the GPL.  Maybe it was some broader message about respect for others' terms.

A nontrivial subset of those very same people can and do violate GPL on the job, in circumstances where their personal scruples count for nothing, or near to it.  Perhaps they're simply overridden by management.  Perhaps the consequences of causing a stir would negatively impact the pay they need to meet life's needs.  Perhaps the time or monetary pressure on the operation require grabbing whatever they can get, wherever they can get it, fast, or else face an ignominious financial end.

And, of course, there are those who hear and understand whatever call to abide by others' terms, and simply disregard them.

On the enforcement side, as usual, the danger is confusing means and ends.  Understanding and counsel can certainly win over those who would comply, but didn't know they had to.  It may win some marginal cases where such individuals have just enough sway within larger organizations to take the day.  It will do nothing to police or induce self-policing among those opposing or indifferent.  If the answer is that the risk is low, compliance will be, too.

Committing to impose any consequences at all doesn't condemn us to slide head first down a slippery slope to draconian oppression.  Effective examples can be made of even unknowing perpetrators, and such examples can encourage more awareness in others where it's currently lacking.

As we do, so as we speak.  Giving GPL the reputation of Ebola or Lenin on a train isn't accurate, effective, or wise.  But reflecting the hard edge of copyleft in its reputation---capturing the imperative on users that "reciprocal" and "share alike" carefully avoid---can and will spread the message of what copyleft is, and the fact that others must comply with it.

It's not that "viral" is a bad metaphor for GPL is or does, on the receiving end.  It's a fine metaphor.  When folks hear it, they get it.  Rather, the problem was that we didn't think sticking the negative valence and involuntary substance of the word "virus" to the most popular free/open license of the time a good strategic idea.  We preferred to pretend GPL was always an opportunity, an invitation, rather than an obligation.

We were wrong.
