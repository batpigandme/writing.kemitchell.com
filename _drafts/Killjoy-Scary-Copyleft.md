In the 1990s and 2000s, competing, coordinated efforts sought to both downplay and overemphasize how scary GPL and other copyleft licenses could be.  GPL was "viral".   Or that was nonsense.  If your engineers included the wrong code, willy nilly, your company had to go open source.   Or it didn't, people would work with you, and everything would work out fine.  GPL was communism.  GPL protected your freedom.

In the end, team "sleep well" prevailed over team "be very afraid".  "GPL is a viral license" has a very 2001 ring to it these days.

But for those ready to see it, we also find evidence aplenty of an overcorrection.  GPL violation is rampant.  Every Best Buy has a gaggle of devices running Linux, and no source is available.  Doing my "introduction to open source" spiel, over and over again, a questions keeps coming from the back of the room:

> Thanks so much for making all this complex license stuff simpler.  But on the copyleft side, really, what's the risk of enforcement here?  If I break the GPL, is anybody really going to come after us?

And the general answer, in all honestly, is that the risk is very low.  Especially for the big projects run by big-name foundations.  The real risk of copyleft enforcement comes from companies releasing copyleft codes, not foundations or solo coders.

For one, enforcing licenses for code published online is never easy.  Possession is nine tenths of open source, and publishing online gives everyone possession of source code.  You have to find out that someone's using your code and ignoring your rules _before_ you realize you need to decide what to do about it.

In addition, the well known foundations stewarding lots of big-name projects have fallen all over themselves to publicly and accountably limit how assertive they can be in license enforcement.  The ["Principles of Community-Oriented GPL Enforcement"](https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/principles.html) are largely a list of _restrictions_ on what GPL enforcers can do.  They are, in effect, elective amendments to the GPL's terms, weakening the leverage of the licensor.  The ["GPL Cooperation Commitment"](https://gplcc.github.io/gplcc/) quite explicitly amends the GPL, "backporting" a section excusing violators from GPLv3 into GPLv2.

Overall, one gathers that the "community" institutions either regret the ongoing existence of copyleft, and would prefer to relicense permissive if they could, or else worries more about charges of lost purity, prestige, or self-righteousness against its enforcement efforts than charges that it doesn't effectively enforce copyleft at all.

Even Moglen, late of FSF, not of Software Freedom Law Center, has written eloquently about the fact that those who would enforce the GPL and other copyleft licenses can't achieve their goals by enforcement.  License enforcers are far outnumbered by potential violators, and violations aren't easy or cheap to detect, attack, and resolve.  To succeed, licensors must convince licensees to police themselves.  I see this realization is at the heart of the FSF's rather conciliatory enforcement approach.
