Software Freedom activists condemn Open Source for stripping Free Software of its ethos, and for breaking promises of practical benefits, without that ethos behind them.  Much foundational Free Software came from developers who believed that all software should be Free.  Free Software is not necessarily more refined, reliable, flexible, or affordable, all in, than closed, and often less so.

Open Source suggests that we can separate Free Software method and Free Software quality from Free Software ethos, by leading with method and quality, and staying on mum on ethos during the pitch.  That suggestion contradicts Free Software's thesis that method and quality flow out of, and from, the shared, underlying ethos.  So Open Source threatens Free Software, and tells us so.

Inner Source delivers on that threat.  Inner Source means transposing Free Software method into closed environments to produce closed software of high quality.  That transposition rejects the Free Software thesis, and affronts the Free Software ethos.  The "Inner" in "Inner Source" bespeaks a closed environment, a barrier between "Inner" and "Outer", impermeable to Software Freedom and unpierced by copyleft.  Inner Source frees those within, and subjugates those without.

Merely suggesting the separability that Inner Source stands for allows proponents to claim that Open Source and Free Software mean the same.  They describe Open Source as a mere rebranding of Free Software, a marketing reboot.  They hold out hope that exposure to Free Software method and Free Software quality will point newcomers back to the underlying ethos.

Inner Source contradicts that theory of Software Freedom ministry.  If Free Software method in a closed environment can produce Free Software quality on its own, even to a lesser extent than Free Software method in the open, then Free Software ethos loses any essential part to play, if software quality motivates the question.  The leap from conviction in software quality to conviction in Free Software ethos can happen only spontaneously, by reading those already predisposed the right sermons.

Even Software Freedom activists embrace this approach.  Most notably, the Free Software Foundation stewards developer tools as useful to non-Free Software developers as Free Software developers.  Software Freedom activists compromise their principles, and make exceptions to their own licenses, to preserve projects as soap boxes.  They choose to proselytize by popularity, at the expense of principle.  In doing so, Free Software activists themselves lead with process and quality, instead of ethos, and suggests the same threat to their own core thesis that Open Source does.

Addicts come to twelve-step programs for sobriety, not religion.  But the higher power is step one.  The masses come to Open Source for software quality and process to get it.  But either as Software Freedom or as Open Source, the Software Freedom devout proselytize by mute example, hoping the flock will inquire about the underlying ethos, and convince themselves.  But there's no necessary step from quality and process to ethos.  Especially if the drive toward quality and process begins and ends in a desire to sell the right to use software for money.  We understand the higher power in the program isn't Bacchus.

Instead, the divorce of process-quality and ethos points to a yawning conceptual gap. Inner Source: transposing Free Software software development methods into private environments.  _Outer Source_: transposing closed, proprietary software development methods into the public environment.

The notion that commerce-evolved, institutional, "corporate" software development methods can produce high quality, publicly available software of  lingered, latent in developer consciousness, just as long as Inner Source.

Lasting attempts to demarcate Free Software and Open Source focused entirely on rights granted for software already produced.  The Debian Free Software Guidelines and Open Source Definition assess not what process produced a given work of software, but whether others got source source and sufficiently generous licenses for it.  Everyone has a process preference.  But no movement, no meaningful consensus, could develop by inviting those preferences to clash.  Only by reducing the scope of consensus---source availability and license terms---could anyone lay a broad enough base to undergird a "movement".  Only by eliding diversity of opinion in the means of publicly available software production could organizers emphasize commonality among software producers making their work available to all.

Commentators still delight in the novelty of Linux and its piecepart, anarchic, Brownian motion evolution.  Contrast with waterfall-model planning and Microsoft's Windows made for high drama, as drama about software production goes.  That saucy narrative elided a great many muddying facts.  Facts, for example, about the solitary origins of many components of modular projects, like the GNU core.  Facts about the development of banner Free Software projects by corporations, largely along "traditional" industry development lines, before widespread Internet penetration and process standardization.
