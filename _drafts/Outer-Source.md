Software Freedom activists condemn Open Source first for stripping Free Software of its ethos, second for oft-broken promises of practical benefit in the absence of that ethos.  Foundational Free Software came from many developers who believed that all software should be free.  Free Software is not necessarily more refined, reliable, flexible, or affordable, all in, than closed, and often less so.

Rhetorically, Open Source suggests that we can separate Free Software method and Free Software quality from Free Software ethos.  That suggestion contradicts Free Software's thesis that method and quality depend on ethos.  So Open Source threatens Free Software, and tells us so.

Rhetorically, Inner Source delivers on that threat.  Inner Source does not suggest, but stands for, transposing Free Software method into closed environments to produce closed software of Free Software quality.  That transposition directly excludes Free Software ethos.  The "Inner" in "Inner Source" bespeaks a closed environment, a barrier between "Inner" and "Outer", impermeable to Software Freedom, unpierced by copyleft.

That Open Source merely suggests the separation that Inner Source stands for leaves Open Source proponents free to maintain that Open Source and Free Software remain synonymous.  Some describe Open Source as a mere rebranding of Free Software.  Some hold out hope that those exposed to Free Software method and shown Free Software quality will come to Free Software ethos.

Inner Source contradicts that strategy of conversion.  If Free Software method alone produces Free Software quality, and the goal is Free Software quality, Free Software ethos has no place.
