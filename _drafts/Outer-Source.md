Software Freedom activists condemn Open Source for stripping Free Software of its ethos, and for breaking promises of practical benefits, without that ethos behind them.

Open Source suggests that we can separate Free Software method and Free Software quality from Free Software ethos, by leading with method and quality, and going light on ethos in its pitch.  That suggestion contradicts Free Software's thesis that method and quality flow out of shared ethos.  Putting ethos last, rather than first, disaffirms Free Software's ethical emphasis.  So Open Source threatens Free Software, and tells us so.

Inner Source delivers on that threat.  Inner Source means transposing Free Software method into closed environments to produce closed software of high quality.  That transposition rejects the Free Software thesis that Free Software quality flows from Free Software ethos.  The "Inner" in "Inner Source" bespeaks a closed environment, a barrier between "Inner" and "Outer", impermeable to Software Freedom and unpierced by copyleft.  Inner Source frees those within, and subjugates those without.

Merely suggesting the separability that Inner Source stands for allows proponents to claim that Open Source and Free Software mean the same.  They describe Open Source as a mere rebranding of Free Software, a marketing reboot.  They hold out hope that exposure to Free Software method and Free Software quality will guide newcomers back to the underlying ethos.

Inner Source contradicts that theory of Software Freedom ministry.  If Free Software method in a closed environment can produce Free Software quality on its own, even if only to a lesser extent than in the open, then Free Software ethos loses any essential part to play when quality drives the question.  The leap from conviction in software quality to conviction in Free Software ethos can happen only spontaneously, by reading the right sermons to those already predisposed.

Even Software Freedom activists embrace this approach.  Most notably, the Free Software Foundation maintains developer tools as useful to non-Free Software developers as Free Software developers.  Software Freedom activists compromise their principles, and make exceptions to their own licenses, allowing use of these tools to build non-Free Software, to preserve the projects as soap boxes.  They choose to proselytize by popularity, at the expense of principle.  In doing so, Free Software activists themselves lead with method and quality, instead of ethos, and suggest the same challenge to their own core thesis that Open Source does.

Addicts come to twelve-step programs for sobriety, not religion.  But the higher power is step two.  Developers come to Open Source for software quality and method.  But the Software Freedom lede is buried, and not essential to the program.  There's no necessary step from quality and method to Free Software ethos.

Many developers' interests in method and quality start and end with their desires to sell non-Free Software for money.  That motivation directly contradicts the ethos Software Freedom activists want to preach.  For these developers, converting to Software Freedom activism through Free Software method makes about as much sense as kicking drink by turning will and life over to Bacchus.

Splitting method and quality from ethos via Inner Source leaves a yawning conceptual gap.  Inner Source, using open software development methods to make closed software, implies _Outer Source_: using closed software development methods to make open software.  The idea that commerce-evolved, institutional, "corporate" software development methods can produce high quality, publicly available software lingers latent in developer consciousness, just as Inner Source did.

Symptomatically, lasting attempts to demarcate Free Software and Open Source focus entirely on rights granted for software already produced, ignoring development method.  The Debian Free Software Guidelines and Open Source Definition assess not what method produced a given work of software, but whether others got source source and sufficiently generous licenses for it.  None of the organizations holding out a definition requires that contributors welcome or accept outside patches, solicit outside bug reports, publish their revision-control history, or maintain any public governance structure.

Every developer harbors process preferences.  Some development methodologies surpass language communities in tribalism.  But no self-identifying movement could coalesce by inviting development creeds to clash.  Only by reducing the scope of agreement to the lower common denominator---source availability and license terms---could anyone lay a broad enough base to claim consensus.

Commentators still delight in the novelty Linux' anarchic, piecepart, Brownian motion mode of evolution.  Contrast with waterfall-model planning and Microsoft's Windows made for high drama, as drama about software methodology goes.  Naturally, the anti-establishment narrative elided a great many uninteresting facts.  Facts, for example, about the solitary origins of many components of modular projects, like the GNU core.  Facts about the development of banner Free Software projects by corporations, largely along "traditional" industry development lines, before widespread Internet penetration and process standardization.  Substantial parts of the Free Software bequest have always come about like non-Free Software programs before them.
