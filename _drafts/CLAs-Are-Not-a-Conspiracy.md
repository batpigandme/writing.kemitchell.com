title: CLAs are Not a Conspiracy
layout: post

I read Ben Balter's [_Why you probably shouldn't add a CLA to your open source project_](https://ben.balter.com/2018/01/02/why-you-probably-shouldnt-add-a-cla-to-your-open-source-project/) three times on an airplane.  I saw the article because I subscribe to Ben's blog, and I subscribe to Ben's blog because I respect the Hell out of Ben, his writing, and his work at GitHub.

I also fundamentally disagree with Ben's post, on points general and specific.

As I understand his argument:

1.  Open source software maintainers, by which Ben means steward-companies like Facebook for React or Google for TensorFlow, prioritize attracting outside contributors.
2.  CLAs increase friction for new contributors.
3.  Plenty of open source projects seem to get by without CLAs.
4.  So by default, don't use them.

I'll quibble with each point in that list.  But I also want to address some themes running through:

1.  CLAs are principally cover-your-ass maneuvers for steward-companies.
2.  GitHub's recently updated site-wide terms of service better solve the underlying problem.
3.  Lawyers are biased against, or incapable of, effective advice on open source licensing and community matters.  Engineers at steward-companies should regard their advice with suspicion, and push back against them.

There's more than one way for a keen eye to see those areas, too.  I'd like to set out some alternative points of view.

## Your Lawyer Doesn't Get It

I'm a lawyer, and I give lots of advice on open source licensing.  The most disturbing part of Ben's post was the way it paints transactional lawyers as narrow-minded specialist-automatons who can't see the whole picture, aren't supposed to, and ought to be resisted or ignored accordingly, even when they're trying to look after the interests of the company a developer happens to be working for.

Ben writes:

> ... legal's role (and area of expertise) is to advise business owners how to minimize risk, not how best to run a successful open source project (the maintainer's area of expertise)

Any transactional lawyer that takes a question from a client, catalogs every conceivable risk, prescribes the maximally effective defense against for each one, and calls the matter resolved has failed to do their job.  They should expect follow-up questions on the likelihoods of the risks they've identified, the costs of the defenses they've described, and alternative, less efficacious, but less costly preventive measures.  In a developed attorney-client relationship, they should come to the question with a sense of the client's taste in risk, their financial picture, and timing, and focus their advice accordingly.  For scrappy upstarts, they should proactively address whether the client can defer a cost until later.   Can they fix it later at reasonable, if greater, cost?

It's also unclear why Ben thinks maintainers rank experts in open source project management.  Whether Ben means "maintainer" in the sense of a steward-company, as he does elsewhere, or individual project founders, my experience doesn't bear out much expertise in open source project management.  I know a number of individuals with long experience developing or managing open source project communities.  But the vast majority of those holding that role that I know see themselves first and foremost and experts in software development.  They're often very reluctant project leaders.

Even seasoned project leaders don't immerse themselves in copyright law or the state of the art in open source licensing.  They tap lawyers with that knowledge when they need it.  When that kind of lawyer stands available to a developer through their company, it's absolutely true that their professional duty requires looking after their client's---the company's---interests.  When the client's decision makers point out that the client's interest is stoking and maintaining an open source developer community, there's no inherent conflict between what the project needs and what the lawyer ought to advise.
