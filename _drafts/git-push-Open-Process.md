Some time ago, I [floated a theory](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/05/18/Schools.html) of divergent instincts in open software.  Those welcomed into open collaboration through monolithic, centralized projects like Linux learn to value the social value of a single, breakaway success and develop a tolerance for the bureaucracy that comes with it.  Those welcomed into open collaboration through modularized, small-component ecosystems like npm learn to value constant, permissionless experiment and develop a tolerance for the thrash and noise that comes with it.

I see the same competing views in open licenses as in open code.

I have thoroughly outed myself as a prolific, permissionless kind of programmer.  I am also a prolific, permissionless kind of license drafter.
