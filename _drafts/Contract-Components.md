I've drafted a bit of contract text, a generic, orthodox, permissive software copyright license:

> 1.  _Licensor_ grants _Licensee_ a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare _Derivative Works_ of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the _Program_ and such _Derivative Works_.
>
> 2.  "**Derivative Works**" means any work that is based on (or derived from) the _Program_ and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. _Derivative Works_ do not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the _Program_ and _Derivative Works_ of the _Program_.

I'd like to reuse these terms in a variety of agreements.  I'd like to share the terms with others, to reuse in their agreements.  I'd like sharing and reusing the terms to be easy.  That's the point of [Common Form](https://commonform.github.io).

The snippet defines _Derivative Works_.  It uses, but does not define, _Licensor_, _Licensee_, and _Program_.  So we can reuse the snippet in a form agreement by providing the missing definitions:

> Customer, Inc. ("**Customer**") and Vendor, LLC ("**Vendor**") agree:
>
> 1.  **Definitions**.
>
>     1.  "**Licensor**" means _Vendor_.
>
>     2.  "**Licensee**" means _Customer_.
>
>     3.  "**Program**" means _Licensor_'s Super Calculator software.
>
> 2.  **Permissive Software Copyright License**.
>     1.  _Licensor_ grants _Licensee_ a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare _Derivative Works_ of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the _Program_ and such _Derivative Works_.
>
>     2.  "**Derivative Works**" means any work that is based on (or derived from) the _Program_ and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. _Derivative Works_ do not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the _Program_ and _Derivative Works_ of the _Program_.

Here's another snippet, a product warranty disclaimer:

> ***Unless required by applicable law,*** **Seller** ***provides the*** **Goods** ***on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.***

This snippet uses, but does not define, _Seller_ and _Goods_.

We can combine these license and disclaimer snippets in a single agreement, by the same technique:

> Customer, Inc. ("**Customer**") and Vendor, LLC ("**Vendor**") agree:
>
> 1.  "**Software**" means _Vendor_'s Super Calculator software.
>
> 2.  **License**.
>
>     1.  **Definitions**.
>
>         1.  "**Licensor**" means _Vendor_.
>
>         2.  "**Licensee**" means _Customer_.
>
>         3.  "**Program**" means the _Software_
>
>     2.  **Permissive Software Copyright License**.
>
>          1.  _Licensor_ grants _Licensee_ a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare _Derivative Works_ of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the _Program_ and such _Derivative Works_.
>
>          2.  "**Derivative Works**" means any work that is based on (or derived from) the _Program_ and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. _Derivative Works_ do not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the _Program_ and _Derivative Works_ of the _Program_.
>
> 3.  **Disclaimer**.
>
>      1.  **Definitions**.
>
>          1.  **Seller** means _Vendor_.
>
>          2.  **Goods** means the _Software_.
>
>      2.  **As Is**.  ***Unless required by applicable law,*** **Seller** ***provides the*** **Goods** ***on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.***

Using definitions in this way allows us to reuse the snippets without changing their text.  That means we could incorporate them by reference, instead of copying:

> ## Agreement
>
> Customer, Inc. ("**Customer**") and Vendor, LLC ("**Vendor**") agree:
>
> 1.  "**Software**" means _Vendor_'s Super Calculator software.
>
> 2.  **License**.
>
>     1.  **Definitions**.
>
>         1.  "**Licensor**" means _Vendor_.
>
>         2.  "**Licensee**" means _Customer_.
>
>         3.  "**Program**" means the _Software_
>
>     2.  **Permissive Software Copyright License**.  The parties incorporate the terms attached as Schedule A here.
>
> 3.  **Disclaimer**.
>
>      1.  **Definitions**.
>
>          1.  **Seller** means _Vendor_.
>
>          2.  **Goods** means the _Software_.
>
>     2.  **As Is**.  The parties incorporate the terms attached as Schedule B here.
>
> ## Schedule A --- License Terms
>
> 1.  _Licensor_ grants _Licensee_ a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare _Derivative Works_ of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the _Program_ and such _Derivative Works_.
>
> 2.  "**Derivative Works**" means any work that is based on (or derived from) the _Program_ and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. _Derivative Works_ do not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the _Program_ and _Derivative Works_ of the _Program_.
>
> ## Schedule B --- Warranty Terms
>
> ***Unless required by applicable law,*** **Seller** ***provides the*** **Goods** ***on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.***

This way of organizing terms mirrors the use of schedules to break up the terms of a complex agreement.  A different attorney can draft each schedule.  Drafters can reuse schedules in other deals that need similar terms.

When a company, industry group, printing house, or [Common Form user](https://commonform.org/publishers/kemitchell) publishes the snippets, we can replace references to schedules with references to the publications:

> Customer, Inc. ("**Customer**") and Vendor, LLC ("**Vendor**") agree:
>
> 1.  "**Software**" means _Vendor_'s Super Calculator software.
>
> 2.  **License**.
>
>     1.  **Definitions**.
>
>         1.  "**Licensor**" means _Vendor_.
>
>         2.  "**Licensee**" means _Customer_.
>
>         3.  "**Program**" means the _Software_
>
>     2.  **Permissive Software Copyright License**.  The parties incorporate the terms published at https://commonform.org/forms/a7a809e0a612369296b06f86205aa752884b29713c32583e9a17760004360bf2 here.

> 3.  **Disclaimer**.
>
>      1.  **Definitions**.
>
>          1.  **Seller** means _Vendor_.
>
>          2.  **Goods** means the _Software_.

Combining snippets of terms in this way doesn't relieve us of the need to read those snippets, even if we've read them before, and know their legal effect.  Even if each snippet does what we expect in substance, the way they're drafted may cause structural issues:

1.  Two snippets might define the same term, like _Person_ or _Material Adverse Change_, in different ways, creating ambiguity.

2.  The agreement itself might define a term in a different way than a snippet does, creating ambiguity.

3.  The agreement and snippets might set other kinds of interpretation rules, like reading _or_ exclusively or clarifying statutory references as pertaining to a particular point in time, that conflict or combine in unfortunate ways.

These potential problems reflect contract drafting conventions:

1.  Unless they say otherwise, definitions apply throughout an agreement.

2.  Unless they say otherwise, other interpretation rules apply throughout an agreement, too.

These are merely conventions, not rules.  Phrasing them this specifically overstates how broadly and particularly lawyers understand and apply them.

Exceptions happen, but infrequently.  Drafters sometimes limit a definition or other interpretation rule to a specific organizational part of their agreement, such as the containing paragraph or a specific section.

Rather than litter agreements with "exclusively for the purposes of this section" and the like, drafters sometimes avoid the unhelpful organizational effects of these rules by attaching terms as separate agreements under one master agreement:

> ## Master Agreement
>
> Customer, Inc. ("**Customer**") and Vendor, LLC ("**Vendor**") agree:
>
> 1.  "**Software**" means _Vendor_'s Super Calculator software.
>
> 2.  **License**.  _Customer_ and _Vendor_ will enter concurrently into the License Agreement attached as Exhibit A, with _Vendor_ as the "Licensor", _Customer_ as the "Licensee", and the _Software_ as the "Program" under that agreement.
>
> 3.  **Disclaimer**.  _Customer_ and _Vendor_ will concurrently enter into the Warranty Disclaimer Agreement attached as Exhibit B, with _Vendor_ as "Seller", _Customer_ as "Buyer", and the _Software_ as the "Goods" under that agreement.
>
> [Signature pages follow.]
>
> ## Exhibit A --- License Agreement
>
> Customer, Inc. ("**Licensee**") and Vendor, LLC ("**Licensor**") agree as follows.  In this agreement, "**Program**" has the same meaning as "Software" in the Master Agreement.
>
>
> 1.  _Licensor_ grants _Licensee_ a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare _Derivative Works_ of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the _Program_ and such _Derivative Works_.
>
> 2.  "**Derivative Works**" means any work that is based on (or derived from) the _Program_ and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. _Derivative Works_ do not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the _Program_ and _Derivative Works_ of the _Program_.
>
> [Signature pages follow.]
>
> ## Exhibit B --- Warranty Disclaimer Agreement
>
> Customer, Inc. ("**Buyer**") and Vendor, LLC ("**Seller**") agree as follows.  In this agreement, "**Goods**" has the same meaning as "Software" in this Master Agreement.
>
> ***Unless required by applicable law,*** **Seller** ***provides the*** **Goods** ***on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.***

Agreements attached as exhibits can explicitly reference, or incorporate definitions from, the master agreement or other exhibit agreements.  But those would be exceptions to the general rule to read agreements independently.  Each agreement develops a vocabulary of defined terms, set of interpretation rules, and numbering scheme all its own.  It can borrow from other agreements and documents from there.

Drafters separate many kinds of complex transactions into multiple agreements in this way.  Changing the rule from sharing all definitions and interpretation rules across all terms of the deal to sharing only those referenced explicitly helps lawyers prepare, review, and negotiate many kinds of complex transactions more reliably and efficiently, in more manageable pieces.  A change to any particular agreement requires less work reviewing other terms to see if they require conforming changes.  Counsel more readily find needed terms to review or revise, by searching in the agreement addressing that subject matter.  Drafters more readily reuse agreements with utility across diverse deal structures, such as purchase agreements, voting agreements, intellectual property agreements, and nondisclosure agreements.  Deal teams more readily delegate large parts of the overall drafting burden, in the form of agreements, to specialists and associates.

These benefits offset the costs of splitting a deal's terms into multiple agreements.  Separate agreements naturally duplicate terms, from definitions to interpretation rules,  to general contract terms, creating a fatter closing volume overall.  It takes some work to ensure that the master agreement correctly incorporates all exhibit agreements.  Clients end up signing many agreements, at one time, to do one deal.

The trade-off makes sense when the benefit of breaking terms up into more manageable pieces outweighs the cost of duplication and more agreements to handle.  The benefit is always good.  How do we drive the cost down, to make the benefit available even for deals with fewer terms?

In short, we use explicit language to apply the rules for separate agreements to specific parts of even single agreements:

> These interpretation rules apply to each "**Component**":
>
> 1.  Definitions in the _Component_ apply only in the _Component_.
>
> 2.  Definitions outside the _Component_ apply in the _Component_ only if they specifically say they do.
>
> 3.  Interpretation rules in a _Component_ apply only in the _Component_.
>
> 4.  Interpretation rules outside the _Component_ apply in the _Component_ only if they specifically say they do.

Armed with this definition, and the ability to apply to sections and organizational parts of our agreements:

> Customer, Inc. ("**Customer**") and Vendor, LLC ("**Vendor**") agree:
>
> 1.  "**Software**" means _Vendor_'s Super Calculator software.
>
> 2.  These interpretation rules apply to each "**Component**":
>
>     1.  Definitions in the _Component_ apply only in the _Component_.
>
>     2.  Definitions outside the _Component_ apply in the _Component_ only if they specifically say they do.
>
>     3.  Interpretation rules in a _Component_ apply only in the _Component_.
>
>     4.  Interpretation rules outside the _Component_ apply in the _Component_ only if they specifically say they do.
>
