title: “Open Source” Is Nobody's Property

You quit a mailing list, people send you links.  You quit Twitter, people send you links.  You go stop reading GitHub issues, people send you links.  I'm tired.  Let's do a blog post, so I have a link to send back.

There is no United States trademark on the phrase "open source".  Nobody has taken that phrase out of the English language and made it their intellectual property.  As far as I'm aware, nobody can stop you from using it as you please.  And it pisses me off when self-interested parties say they can, especially when they skirt the line of claiming force of law to do it.

Run your play, but don't misrepresent the law to do it.

The organization whose partisans claim to own the phrase "open source", the Open Source Initiative, has four United States trademark registrations.  Trademark registrations are public records available free online: registration numbers [86191623](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=86191623&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch), [78813707](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=78813707&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch), [77414159](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=77414159&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch), and [77414187](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=77414187&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch).  Three are for `OPEN SOURCE INITIATIVE` and related logos.  One is for `OPEN SOURCE INITIATIVE APPROVED LICENSE`.

`OPEN SOURCE` is part of those marks, so the Open Source Initiative has trademarked `OPEN SOURCE`, right?

Wrong.

Expand the "Mark Information" tab of any summary page on the Trademark Office's website, and you'll see something like this:

Note the disclaimer line:

> Disclaimer: "OPEN SOURCE"

What does that mean, "disclaimer"?  Pull down the registration certificates, like [this one for registration number 86191623](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn86191623&docId=ORC20141007005630#docIndex=1&page=1), and read for yourself:

In other words, the Open Source Initiative has an exclusive right to use `OPEN SOURCE INITIATIVE` and `OPEN SOURCE INITIATIVE APPROVED LICENSE`.  Those exclusive rights are called trademarks.  But it _doesn't_ have any trademark on `OPEN SOURCE` alone.  It can't use trademark law to stop you from using it.

The Open Source Initiative itself [said so itself](https://opensource.org/pressreleases/certified-open-source.php), back when Eric Raymond was still president:

> On June 15 1999 ZDNet broke the news that OSI's application for an Open Source trademark had lapsed, anticipating the public statement OSI had planned to make following its board meeting on 17 June. Subsequently, many people have expressed concern that the phrase "Open Source" might be trademarked by some party hostile to the open-source community.
>
> That's not likely, for the very reason the application was permitted to lapse. <mark>We have discovered that there is virtually no chance that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office would register the mark "open source"; the mark is too descriptive.</mark> Ironically, we were partly a victim of our own success in bringing the "open source" concept into the mainstream.
>
> So "Open Source" is not and cannot become a trademark. The purposes for which OSI sought a trademark, however, are still valid. We believe the open-source community gains much from the existence of a recognizable brand name — one which certifies to users that software is being distributed under the licensing model best shown to produce high quality software. We believe that software vendors will seek to use an appropriate certification mark to signify that quality.

Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that.  OSI didn't apply to trademark `OPEN SOURCE`.  Software in the Public Interest, the corporate home of [Debian](https://debian.org), did.  That older application hasn't been fully digitized online, but you can [find the relevant metadata easily enough](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75439502&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch).  You can [dig up the messy political history](https://lwn.net/1998/1203/a/trademark.html) about transferring control of the application from SPI to OSI, too.  Long story short, Bruce Perens has quit OSI at least twice.

But in the end, the application for `OPEN SOURCE` full stop was abandoned, not rejected by the Trademark Office.  I wasn't privy to that process, but I can guess why neither SPI nor OSI bothered following up to take it over the line.  Once they got a lawyer involved---none was listed on the application---that lawyer would have told them they would fail.  The phrase "open source" was too descriptive, and arguably already taken.

Some trademarks are easier to get, easier to defend, and easier to enforce than others.  At the top of the food chain are "fanciful" marks like "Kodak" and "Xerox".  These are essentially linguistic greenfield, made-up words with no existing meaning to conflict with.  Below that lie "arbitrary" marks, which do have existing meaning, but not any meaning to do with the goods, service, or company using the mark.  Think "Apple" for computers.  There follow "suggestive" marks, which not only have existing meaning, but have meaning that suggests some quality of the good or service offered by the business.  Think "Greyhound" for bus transportation.

Toward the bottom of the hierarchy, we have "descriptive" marks.  These amount to little more than commonly understandable descriptions of goods or services.  As a general policy, trademark law does not support seizing bits of the English language, weaponizing them as trademarks, and using those trademarks to sue others who quite naturally use the same words to describe their own products and services.

It is _possible_ for a description to become a protectable trademark in time.  But only with a lot of evidence showing that people out in the market actually associate a descriptive word or phrase with a specific provider of goods or services of the type.  On the flip side, well protected names can lose their protection if they become so popular that the name of a brand replaces the name of the object.  Like "hoover" for "vacuum cleaner" in England.  The Open Source Initiative has done neither.

"Open Source" is woefully descriptive for software whose source is open, for the everyday meanings of "open" and "source", blurry as they may be.  If nobody had ever used the phrase "open source" in software, and a new client came to me next week asking about using and protecting the name, I'd strongly advise them to pick a different one.  There's an infinitude of potential names out there.  Why pick one you probably can't get, and can't even lose without a fight?

Alas, in actual history, plenty of people used the terms "open" and even "open source" before SPI tried to trademark it and OSI tried to run with it.  [Here's a use of "Open Source" from 1993 in an archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32/WoBvPB0U9Co/wXfpq5nEJTYJ) ... of a list about Windows software.  [Here's Caldera using it in a marketing release for DOS.](http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/fall96/0269.html in 1996)

In fact, tacking "open" onto "source" likely seemed inevitable, even before it happened.  "Open" as a marketing term in industry was decades old, and apparently played out.  Christine Peterson, [the one who suggested "open source" at the O'Reilly-brokered meeting](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/coining-term-open-source-software) that gave birth to the OSI and its media blitz, mentioned that she initially ran the idea past a friend in marketing, who [warned her that "open" was already value, overused, and thoroughly abused](https://lccn.loc.gov/2018953693).  A whole book, _Open Systems: The Reality_ had been published in 1993 on the proliferation of competing, vague definitions of "open" by software and hardware vendors.  The editors found a single flicker of clarity through the chaos from a 1991 conference attendee:

> It took me a long time to understand what (the industry) meant by open vs. proprietary, but I finally figured it out.  From the perspective of any one supplier, open meant "our products."  Proprietary meant "everybody else's products."

This was well before the birth of the Open Source Initiative.  But not before the birth of the [Open Softare Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Software_Foundation) in 1988, which later merged with X to form [The Open Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group), which is still around.
