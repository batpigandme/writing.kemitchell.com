You quit a mailing list, people link you to archives.  You quit Twitter, people link you to tweets.  You go stop reading GitHub, people link you to issues.  I'm tired.  I need something to link to.

[This is a blog post, not a legal opinion.](https://notlegaladvice.law)  I will publish this gratis and sincerely hope never to lay eyes on it again.  If you need to make a big decision about whether and how to dive the "open source" grab ball, hire a lawyer, or at least do some research of your own.  Don't read one blog post you like the sound of, stop, and blame me.

Here is the part that will tempt you:  I see no evidence that the Open Source Initiative has any legal power to police the phrase "open source".  I see---and am sent---plenty of insinuation to the contrary.  Hence this post.

I should mention that I have an interest in this issue.  I've taken flak for calling [licenses](https://paritylicense.com), [projects](https://licensezero.com), and [business models](https://duallicensing.com) open source without any kiss of the Initiative's ring.  I still do.  And no, it doesn't hurt.

It used to.  If you'd asked me a few years ago about the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd), I'd've [sang its praises as monumental and compelling](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2016/05/13/What-Open-Source-Means.html#instinct).  Because that's what I'd read about it on the Internet since I was a kid.  Mostly, as it turns out, on the OSI's own website, and the websites of its patrons.  Then I actually engaged with the process, and began reading the records of processes past.

With the benefit of field experience, included but not limited to [actually reading the Definition critically](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2018/11/05/OSD-Copyleft-Regulation.html), not to mention [a long look behind the curtains of OSI politics and process](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/04/23/OSD-wontfix.html), I now see the OSI story as a two year triumph and a twenty year tragedy. The work OSI existed to do is long since done, consisting far more in carrying off a marketing coup in 1998 than preserving its memory a wasting asset to 2020.  I now see OSI doing more to stymie opposition to industry abuses than to galvanize it.  It is like the startup that, having long since made its highest placed funders and founders rich, lumbers on as an artifact of a past triumph, courting new patrons nearer their prime.  In more practical terms, it's unclear what initiative the Initiative has left, beyond attempting to police the term "open source" across all of social media.

But there's no such thing as police without law.

Legally, there is no registered United States or European trademark on the phrase "open source" for licenses, software, or computer services.  As a result, nobody can use national trademark law to stop you or me or anyone else from calling things "open source" without their approval or permission.  The badge that a term policeman would wear, the seal on a trademark certificate, doesn't exist.

OSI has a total of four United States trademark registrations to its name.  Fortunately, United States trademark registrations are public records: OSI has registration numbers 86191623, 77414159, and 77414187 for `OPEN SOURCE INITIATIVE`, with and without logos, plus number 78813707 for `OPEN SOURCE INITIATIVE APPROVED LICENSE`.  You can copy those numbers into [The United States Patent and Trademark Office's free status and documents database](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/) and click "Status" to see for yourself.

But wait!  `OPEN SOURCE` is a substring of each of those marks, so the Open Source Initiative has trademarked `OPEN SOURCE`, right?

Wrong.

Expand the "Mark Information" tab of any summary page on the Trademark Office's website, you'll see something like this:

![mark information](/images/osi-mark-information.png)

Note the line:

> Disclaimer: "OPEN SOURCE"

What does that mean, "disclaimer"?  Aren't trademark certificates about "claiming", no "dis-"?

Pull down the registration certificates, like [this one for registration number 86191623](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn86191623&docId=ORC20141007005630#docIndex=1&page=1), and read for yourself:

![disclaimer language](/images/osi-mark-disclaimer.jpg)

In other words, the Open Source Initiative has an exclusive right to use `OPEN SOURCE INITIATIVE` and `OPEN SOURCE INITIATIVE APPROVED LICENSE` for certain kinds of goods and services.  Those exclusive rights are called [trademarks, a form of intellectual property](https://fieldguide.kemitchell.com/#trademarks).  But the Open Source Initiative _doesn't_ have any trademark on `OPEN SOURCE` alone or as a substring of other, longer names and phrases.  OSI "owns" the string `OPEN SOURCE` on the public record only as substrings of the marks it was actually able to register.

Why would the Open Source Initiative file trademark applications _not_ claiming `OPEN SOURCE` in big capital letters?  Because it had to.  As the organization itself [announced](https://opensource.org/pressreleases/certified-open-source.php) back in its heyday, when Eric Raymond was still president:

> On June 15 1999 ZDNet broke the news that OSI's application for an Open Source trademark had lapsed, anticipating the public statement OSI had planned to make following its board meeting on 17 June. Subsequently, many people have expressed concern that the phrase "Open Source" might be trademarked by some party hostile to the open-source community.
>
> That's not likely, for the very reason the application was permitted to lapse. <mark>We have discovered that there is virtually no chance that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office would register the mark "open source"; the mark is too descriptive.</mark> Ironically, we were partly a victim of our own success in bringing the "open source" concept into the mainstream.
>
> So "Open Source" is not and cannot become a trademark. The purposes for which OSI sought a trademark, however, are still valid. We believe the open-source community gains much from the existence of a recognizable brand name — one which certifies to users that software is being distributed under the licensing model best shown to produce high quality software. We believe that software vendors will seek to use an appropriate certification mark to signify that quality.

Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that.  OSI didn't apply to trademark `OPEN SOURCE`.  [Software in the Public Interest](https://www.spi-inc.org/), the corporate home of [Debian](https://debian.org), did, before OSI had legally formed.  That older application hasn't been fully digitized, but you can [find the relevant metadata easily enough](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75439502&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch).  You can [dig up the messy political history](https://lwn.net/1998/1203/a/trademark.html) about transferring control of the abortive application from SPI to OSI, too.

In the end, the application for `OPEN SOURCE` full stop was abandoned.  I wasn't privy to that process, but I can guess why neither SPI nor OSI bothered meeting the deadline for a response to the Trademark Office's objections.  Once they got a lawyer involved---none was listed on SPI's application---that lawyer would have told them their application was doomed.  The phrase "open source" was too descriptive.  What's more, it was already in use.  Rather played out, in fact.

Some words and phrases are easier to claim, defend, and enforce as trademarks than others.  At the top of the food chain are "fanciful" marks like `KODAK` and `XEROX`.  These are essentially linguistic greenfield, made-up words with no existing usages to run afoul of.  Below those lie "arbitrary" marks, which do have existing meaning, but not any meaning to do with the goods, service, or company using the mark.  Think `APPLE` for computers.  There follow "suggestive" marks, which not only have existing meaning, but have meaning that suggests some quality of the good or service offered by the business.  Think `GREYHOUND` for bus transportation.

At the bottom of the hierarchy, we have "descriptive" marks.  These amount to little more than commonly understood statements about goods or services.  As a general rule, trademark law does not enable private interests to seize bits of the English language, weaponize them as exclusive property, and sue others who quite naturally use the same words in the same way to describe their own products and services.  Our system doesn't dent free speech so lightly.

It is _possible_ for a description to become a trademark in time.  But only by collecting a lot of compelling evidence, over a long span, showing that a descriptive word or phrase has actually morphed into a codeword pointing exclusively to a specific provider of goods or services in the common tongue.  On the flip side, even well protected fanciful trademarks can lose protection if they become so popular that they becomes synonymous with a good or service, no matter who provides it.  Think "hoover" for "vacuum cleaner" in the UK.

The phrase "open source" is woefully descriptive for software whose source is open, for common meanings of "open" and "source", blurry as they may be.  If I'd never heard the phrase "open source" before, and a new client came to me next week asking about using and protecting the name, I'd strongly advise them to invest in something they can own, instead.  There's an infinitude of potential names out there.  Why pick one you can't get, or can only get in a tenuous, contestable way at great expense?

We can see the descriptiveness of "open source" in action before OSI began in 1998.  Plenty of people used the terms "open" and even "open source" before SPI tried to trademark it.  [Here's a use of "Open Source" from 1993 in a mail archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32/WoBvPB0U9Co/wXfpq5nEJTYJ) ... of a list about Windows software.  [Here's Caldera using it in a marketing release for DOS.](http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/fall96/0269.html in 1996)

And of course we can see it used since OSI for all manner of projects, companies, and initiatives proceeding without their blessing.  Just follow the Term Police on social media, and track their targets, one after another, month after month, year after year.  Every usage OSI partisans feel compelled to stamp out is that much more evidence of the damage and confusion the legal rules against descriptive trademarks effectively prevent.  So is the broader, consistent pattern of new, unauthorized uses popping up all the time.

In fact, tacking "open" onto "source" seemed just as inevitable before OSI as it does now.  The meaning of "source" isn't really the issue.  But the real meat, "open", had done decades of service in industry marketing by the time the Open Source Initiative came around, to the point of feeling fairly well sucked dry.

Christine Peterson, [who suggested "open source" at the O'Reilly-brokered meeting that kicked off the OSI media blitz](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/coining-term-open-source-software), wrote that she initially ran the idea past a friend in marketing, who [warned her that "open" was already vague, overused, and cliche](https://lccn.loc.gov/2018953693).  A whole book, _Open Systems: The Reality_ had been published in 1993 on the proliferation of competing, vague definitions of "open" by software and hardware vendors in the years before.  The editors found a single flicker of clarity through the chaos from a 1991 conference attendee:

> It took me a long time to understand what (the industry) meant by open vs. proprietary, but I finally figured it out.  From the perspective of any one supplier, open meant "our products."  Proprietary meant "everybody else's products."

This was long before the birth of the Open Source Initiative.  But not before the birth of the [Open Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Software_Foundation) in 1988---a decade before OSI---which later merged with X to form [The Open Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group), which is still around.

In short, "open" was an easy word to like and an impossible word to control, the [apple of discord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_of_Discord) of computer salesspeak.  It's a vague, connotation-positive generalism whose metaphorical potential dwarfs its literal meaning, even in everyday speech.

A whole generation of IT buyers had latched onto that potential before the Internet era, or even the dawn of personal computing, as the rallying cry of newfound buyer-side leverage.  And a whole corresponding generation of IT sellers, sprouted up where IBM had fallen, thus shifting the balance of power back to customers, took notice, dog-piled on, and fairly well ripped the term to shreds by a million ads, trade show pavilions, press releases, and conference talks.  Everybody was "open", so nobody was. 

The O'Reilly-facilitated working group that set out to rebrand "free software" without Richard Stallman either neglected this history, saw the buzzword as abandoned, or believed they'd happened on "open" first, like [treasure under a tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pardoner%27s_Tale).  Their successors have had to face harsh reality more squarely.

Cue [this awkward page](https://opensource.org/authority) entitled "International Authority & Recognition" on the OSI's website circa 2015, plus the more recent ["Affirmation of the Open Source Definition"](https://opensource.org/OSD_Affirmation) of last year.  The former drips with language designed to imply power without any demonstration of it.  Long on words, short on action.  Tellingly, none of the sources cited in the English language bestow any right on the Open Source Initiative to impose its definition, process, or approval on anyone else.  At least some merely reflect the extent to which the institution of OSI fits institution-shaped holes in the logics of other institutions.  Still others boil down to mere testimonials.

Testimonials are all of the substance of the signatories to the more recent "affirmation".  The need for such a call to circle the wagons did more to confirm the tenuousness of OSI authority than to reinforce it with anyone not already riding in the train.

None of these performative announcements or word-picking pufferies would be necessary with a single, seven-digit United States trademark number.  [Here's my personal certificate for `WAYPOINT` for downloadable legal forms.](https://waypointnda.com/files/trademark.pdf)  No testimonials, back scratching, or name-drops needed.  And no disclaimers.  Trade on my name, I'll sue and get a court order.  Not that I'll have to.  The mark is a public record.

The Open Source Initiative doesn't have that, and they know it.  But rather than accept that intellectual property law simply doesn't cover what they want to own---the words "open source" for licenses and software remain the public domain---they contrive to control it as if they owned it, and to convince developers and companies that they do, by other means.  Every statement of OSI's presumed authority---OSI defines open source, software isn't "open source" unless OSI approves---comes with an implicit "should" and "OSI says".  OSI says OSI defines "open source".  OSI says software shouldn't be called "open source" unless OSI approves.

This explains the constant temptation to short-circuit debate by invoking authority of law, to use "lawyers say" like `sudo` in ["`sudo` make me a sandwich"](https://xkcd.com/149/).  OSI partisans make some better arguments for discipline in use of the term.  In my opinions, none particularly strong.  But a surprising number of weaker ones boil down to ["Respect our authority!"](https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/vanep11&div=17) when read in context.

Of course, even if the law hasn't explicitly recognized "open source" as anyone's property, the law never draws perfectly sharp lines.  I'd be remiss to pretend the desperate couldn't pull on few frayed edges of the facts and the rules.

Federal trademarks, for one, aren't the only trademarks, at least in the United States.  Firms can also make trademark claims under the laws of specific states, at least for business done within those states.  But there are reasons---both legal and practical---that we look first and foremost to federal law when it comes to trademarks.  Symptomatically, I could name dozens of lawyers who've helped clients apply to register federal trademarks.  I couldn't name anyone that I'm sure has done a state registration or claim in the past five years.  By impression, ntate claims are for litigators, when somebody screws up the federal claim, and they need a fallback.  And of course for [cannabis companies](https://cannabis.ca.gov/2019/04/29/registering-cannabis-related-trademarks-in-california/), the exception to everything, because that business is still illegal under federal law.

OSI could also dig deep for claims of deceit and unfair dealing, arguing that whether it controls the use of "open source" or not, its definition reflects ironclad consumer expectations, and those expectations are grievously exploited by anyone saying "open source" without their blessing.  That is, of course, circular.  It is also counterfactual, on two important levels.

[The Open Source Definition was originally the Debian Free Software Guidelines.](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/11/12/DFSG-versus-OSD.html)  The Debian Free Software Guidelines were written on a private mailing list, evidently without legal input, then announced as fait accompli, more than twenty years ago, as part of the [Debian Social Contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract).  Open Source Initiative mailing list regulars decry ["crayon licenses"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crayon_license) written without legal input or public feedback.  But they sanctify a "crayon definition" produced in just the same way.

I believe such a document falls well short of the kind of objective polling required to show either the "acquired distinctiveness" for turning a chunk of English into a trademark or inevitable, predictable, damaging commercial deception amounting to a breach of fair competition.  To claim deceit based on that kind of unilateral territory marking is to presuppose a consensus that does not exist.  Which explains OSI's reluctance to heed repeated calls for independent, objective surveys of how developers actually understand the phrase "open source", what they know, if anything, about the Open Source Initiative or its Open Source Definition, and what essential connection, if any, they see from one to ther other before they're indoctrinate or shouted down.

In the end, fuzzy legal fallbacks are just that: last resorts.  In the United States, federal trademark registration isn't the gold standard, it's the greenback, the everyday coin of the trademark realm.

Overall, based on the research I've been able to squeeze in over the years, no person and no organization owns the phrase "open source" as we know it.  Our right to speak the term freely, and to argue for our own meanings, traditions, and goals, isn't impinged by anybody's intellectual property.  No legal shadow hangs over it.

That right extends to debate about how we ought or ought not use the term, for OSI partisans as well as those annoyed and bemused by them.  But that debate must be won by reason and suasion, not harassment and authority.  There are only dogs in this fight.  No masters.
