You quit a mailing list, people send you links to archives.  You quit Twitter, people send you links to tweets.  You go stop reading GitHub, people send you links to issues.  I'm tired.  I need something to link to.

[This is a blog post, not a legal opinion.](https://notlegaladvice.law)  I will publish this post and sincerely hope that I will never look at it again.  If you need to make a big decision about whether and how to dive the "open source" grab ball in commerce, hire a lawyer, or at least do some research of your own.  Don't read one blog post and stop.

I should also mention that I have an interest in this issue.  If you'd asked me a few years ago about the Open Source Definition, I'd've sang its praises as monumental and authoritative.  Mostly because that's what I'd read about it on the Internet, and mostly on OSI's own site, since I was a kid.  With the benefit of field experience, not to mention a long look behind the curtains of OSI politics and process, I now see its pretensions and especially its social media Term Police as abusive and broadly harmful.  Basically, it's an interest group, like most things sponsored by a mess of people and firms from one line of work.  It does more to control those opposing the abuses of that industry than to represent them.

As far as I can tell, based on the research I've been able to squeeze in over the years, no person and no organization owns the phrase "open source" as we know it.  Our rights to speak freely with the term aren't impinged by anybody's proprietary right.  Nobody has special powers to control that combo of well worn English words, or to prevail on the government to do so.

In law-speak, there is no United States or European trademark on the phrase "open source" for licenses, software, or computer services.  As a result, nobody can stop you or me or anyone else from using it "in commerce" without their approval or permission.  And it pisses me off when self-interested parties say they can, or tactically imply that nebulous others will, especially when they toe and cross the line of claiming the law or lawyers say so.

Run your play.  Make your point.  Win the debate, if you can, and be prepared to keep winning it, forever.  But don't misrepresent the law to do so.  There are only dogs in this fight.

The organization whose partisans repeatedly claim to "own" the phrase "open source", the Open Source Initiative, has a total of four United States trademark registrations.  Fortunately, United States trademark registrations are public records: OSI has registration numbers 86191623, 77414159, and 77414187 for `OPEN SOURCE INITIATIVE`, with and without logos, and 78813707 for `OPEN SOURCE INITIATIVE APPROVED LICENSE`.  You can copy those numbers into [TSDR](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/) and click "Status" to see for yourself.

`OPEN SOURCE` is a substring of each of those marks, so the Open Source Initiative has trademarked `OPEN SOURCE`, right?

Wrong.

Expand the "Mark Information" tab of any summary page on the Trademark Office's website, you'll see something like this:

![mark information](/images/osi-mark-information.png)

Note the line:

> Disclaimer: "OPEN SOURCE"

What does that mean, "disclaimer"?  Pull down the registration certificates, like [this one for registration number 86191623](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn86191623&docId=ORC20141007005630#docIndex=1&page=1), and read for yourself:

![disclaimer language](/images/osi-mark-disclaimer.jpg)

In other words, the Open Source Initiative has an exclusive right to use `OPEN SOURCE INITIATIVE` and `OPEN SOURCE INITIATIVE APPROVED LICENSE` for certain kinds of goods and services.  Those exclusive rights are called [trademarks, a form of intellectual property](https://fieldguide.kemitchell.com/#trademarks).  But the Open Source Initiative _doesn't_ have any trademark on `OPEN SOURCE` alone or as part of other, longer marks different from the ones it has registered.  It "owns" the string `OPEN SOURCE` only in the context of the marks it was able to register.

Why would the Open Source Initiative file trademark applications _not_ to own `OPEN SOURCE`?  Because it had to.  As the organization itself [announced](https://opensource.org/pressreleases/certified-open-source.php), back when Eric Raymond was still president:

> On June 15 1999 ZDNet broke the news that OSI's application for an Open Source trademark had lapsed, anticipating the public statement OSI had planned to make following its board meeting on 17 June. Subsequently, many people have expressed concern that the phrase "Open Source" might be trademarked by some party hostile to the open-source community.
>
> That's not likely, for the very reason the application was permitted to lapse. <mark>We have discovered that there is virtually no chance that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office would register the mark "open source"; the mark is too descriptive.</mark> Ironically, we were partly a victim of our own success in bringing the "open source" concept into the mainstream.
>
> So "Open Source" is not and cannot become a trademark. The purposes for which OSI sought a trademark, however, are still valid. We believe the open-source community gains much from the existence of a recognizable brand name — one which certifies to users that software is being distributed under the licensing model best shown to produce high quality software. We believe that software vendors will seek to use an appropriate certification mark to signify that quality.

Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that.  OSI didn't apply to trademark `OPEN SOURCE`.  [Software in the Public Interest](https://www.spi-inc.org/), the corporate home of [Debian](https://debian.org), did.  That older application hasn't been fully digitized online, but you can [find the relevant metadata easily enough](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75439502&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch).  You can [dig up the messy political history](https://lwn.net/1998/1203/a/trademark.html) about transferring control of the application from SPI to OSI, too.

In the end, the application for `OPEN SOURCE` full stop was abandoned, not rejected by the Trademark Office.  I wasn't privy to that process, but I can guess why neither SPI nor OSI bothered meeting the deadline for a response to the Trademark Office's objections.  Once they got a lawyer involved---none was listed on SPI's initial, abortive application---that lawyer would have told them they they were doomed to fail.  The phrase "open source" was too descriptive.  What's more, it was already in use.  Rather played out, in fact.

Some words and phrases are easier to claim, defend, and enforce as trademarks than others.  At the top of the food chain are "fanciful" marks like `KODAK` and `XEROX`.  These are essentially linguistic greenfield, made-up words with no existing usage to run afoul of.  Below those lie "arbitrary" marks, which do have existing meaning, but not any meaning to do with the goods, service, or company using the mark.  Think `APPLE` for computers.  There follow "suggestive" marks, which not only have existing meaning, but have meaning that suggests some quality of the good or service offered by the business.  Think `GREYHOUND` for bus transportation.

At the bottom of the hierarchy, we have "descriptive" marks.  These amount to little more than commonly understood statements about goods or services.  As a general rule, trademark law does not enable private interests to seize bits of the English language, weaponize them as exclusive property, and sue others who quite naturally use the same words in the same way to describe their own products and services.

It is _possible_ for a description to become a trademark in time.  But only with a lot of evidence, over a lot of time, showing that a descriptive word or phrase has actually morphed into the mark of a specific provider of goods or services in the common tongue.  On the flip side, even well protected arbitrary trademarks can lose protection if they become so popular that they becomes synonymous with a good or service, no matter who provides it.  Think "hoover" for "vacuum cleaner" in the UK.

The phrase "open source" is woefully descriptive for software whose source is open, for common meanings of "open" and "source", blurry as they may be.  If nobody had ever used the phrase "open source" in software, and a new client came to me next week asking about using and protecting the name, I'd strongly advise them to invest in something they can own, instead.  There's an infinitude of potential names out there.  Why pick one you can't get, or can only get in a tenuous, contestable way at great expense?

We can see the descriptiveness of "open source" in action before OSI began in 1998.  Plenty of people used the terms "open" and even "open source" before SPI tried to trademark it.  [Here's a use of "Open Source" from 1993 in an archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32/WoBvPB0U9Co/wXfpq5nEJTYJ) ... of a list about Windows software.  [Here's Caldera using it in a marketing release for DOS.](http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/fall96/0269.html in 1996)

And of course we can see it used since OSI for all all manner of projects, companies, and initiatives proceeding without their blessing.  Just follow the folks persecuting the heretics, one after another, month after month, on social media.  Every usage OSI partisans feel compelled to suppress is that much further evidence of the damage and confusion the legal rules against descriptive trademarks effectively prevent.

In fact, tacking "open" onto "source" seemed as inevitable then as it does now.  "Open" as a marketing term in industry was decades old by the time the Open Source Initiative came around, to the point of feeling fairly well sucked dry in industry circles.  Christine Peterson, [the one who suggested "open source" at the O'Reilly-brokered meeting](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/coining-term-open-source-software) that gave birth to the OSI media blitz, wrote that she initially ran the idea past a friend in marketing, who [warned her that "open" was already vague, overused, and cliche](https://lccn.loc.gov/2018953693).  A whole book, _Open Systems: The Reality_ had been published in 1993 on the proliferation of competing, vague definitions of "open" by software and hardware vendors in the years before.  The editors found a single flicker of clarity through the chaos from a 1991 conference attendee:

> It took me a long time to understand what (the industry) meant by open vs. proprietary, but I finally figured it out.  From the perspective of any one supplier, open meant "our products."  Proprietary meant "everybody else's products."

This was well before the birth of the Open Source Initiative.  But not before the birth of the [Open Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Software_Foundation) in 1988---a decade before---which later merged with X to form [The Open Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group), which is still around.

In short, "open" was an easy word to like and an impossible word to control, the [apple of discord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_of_Discord) of the computer sales world.  It's a vague, connotation-positive generalism whose metaphorical potential often dwarfs its literal meaning, even in everyday speech.  A whole generation of IT buyers had latched onto that potential before the Internet era, or even the dawn of personal computing, as the rallying cry of their newfound buy-side power.  And a whole generation of vendor and integrator pushers, sprouted up where IBM had fallen, took notice, dog-piled, and fairly well ripped it to shreds by a million ads, trade show pavilions, and conference talks. 

Everybody was "open", so nobody was.  The O'Reilly-facilitated working group that set out to rebrand "free software" without Richard Stallman either neglected this history or believed they'd happened on "open" first, like [treasure under a tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pardoner%27s_Tale).

Their successors have come to face harsh the reality more squarely.

Cue [this awkward page entitled "International Authority & Recognition"](https://opensource.org/authority), on the OSI's website since at least 2015, plus the more recent ["Affirmation of the Open Source Definition"](https://opensource.org/OSD_Affirmation) of last year.  The former drips with language designed to imply power, without any demonstration of it.  Tellingly, none of the sources cited in the English language bestow any power on the Open Source Initiative to impose its view on anyone else.  At least some references merely express the extent to which the institution of OSI fits institution-shaped holes in the logics of other institutions.  Others boil down to mere testimonials, which is exactly the substance of the signatories to the more recent "affirmation", which did more to confirm that OSI was feeling heat than to lower the temperature.

Crucially, none of this would be necessary with a single, seven-digit United States trademark number.  [Here's my personal certificate for `WAYPOINT` for downloadable legal forms.](https://waypointnda.com/files/trademark.pdf)  No testimonials, back scratching, or name-drops needed.  And no disclaimers.  Trade on my name, I'll sue and get a court order.  Not that I'll have to.  The mark is a public record.

The Open Source Initiative doesn't have that, and they know it.  But rather than accept that intellectual property law simply doesn't cover what they want to own---the words "open source" for licenses and software---they contrive to control it, and to convince developers and companies that they own it, by other means.  Every statement of OSI's presumed authority---OSI defines open source. It's not "open source" unless OSI approves.---comes with an implicit "should" and an implicit "OSI says".  OSI says OSI has the authority to define "open source".  OSI says it shouldn't be called "open source" unless OSI approves.

Hence the temptation to invoke the law, to use "lawyers say" like `sudo` in ["`sudo` make me a sandwich"](https://xkcd.com/149/).  On its face, the law hasn't recognized "open source" as anyone's property.  But neither does the law draw perfectly clear, bold lines.  There is nearly always room to fall back on the frayed edges and faded pages of legal rules.

Federal trademarks, for one, aren't the only trademarks in the United States.  Firms can also pursue claims under the laws of individual states.  But there are reasons---legal and very practical---we look first and foremost to the federal trademark register.

OSI could fall back on claims of deceit and unfair dealing, say that whether it controls the use of "open source" or not, its definition reflects ironclad consumer expectations, and those expectations are grievously exploited by anyone saying "open source" without their welcome.  That is, of course, circular.

It is also counterfactual.  The Open Source Definition was originally the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  The Debian Free Software Guidelines were written on a private mailing list, evidently without legal input, then announced as fait accompli, more than twenty years ago.  That is hardly the kind of broad-based polling required to show the "acquired distinctiveness" needed to turn a description of English into private property.  To claim deceit based on that kind of unilateral territory marking is to presuppose a consensus that does not exist, now if it ever did.  Which explains the organization's resistance to repeated proposals for independent, objective surveys of what developers actually know about the Open Source Initiative and the Open Source Definition, if anything, and how those not already vesting interested in the organization understand the phrase "open source".
