"Open core" means proprietary software.  We call it "open core" to suggest that the proprietary software comes from an open place, that it's proprietary in practice, but open at heart.  That we'd be all open if we could be, but partly proprietary because we have to be.

When we use "open core" as a kind of apologia, its muted, defensive vibe can strike the right tone in the moment.  But the louder companies and the industry declare that open core is a bona fide, established, viable, unapologetic _thing_, the less that note rings true to anyone else.   Declaring for all the world to hear that you are proud of, and defined by, your regrettable need for compromise is not a great story.  No one is inspired to run out and compromise.

If you want to make software, but can't or won't just give it all away unconditionally, there are three good stories the industry knows how to hear and tell.  This post will lay them out, one by one, so you can decide which appeal to you, and which you might be able to tell about your own work.

<h2 id="business">This is a business.</h2>
Rent is reality.  Medical bills are reality.  Retirement costs are reality.  If someone's surprised or offended to find a business lurking behind good software, which takes good people, who need good money---that's their naivete or simple selfishness acting out, not a righteous rebuke for any moral failing or unfair ambush on your part.  It's not for your company to sweat the Neverland expectations of those who've only just got out of college, or took jobs at large companies that do their best to provide a seamless, infantilizing transition.

I strongly suspect that most business folks who find "open core" helpful came to the intersection of open and proprietary from the open side.  That explains the generally apologetic vibe of the term.  But it's perfectly possible to start from business _as_ business and work back to openness by simple deduction from received business wisdom.  Freemium and loss-leader strategies---pejoratively, "bait and switch" and "first hit's free"---show up all over the place, not just in software.  "Free" as applied to software means "open source".

Especially if hard-nosed business realism story _doesn't_ appeal to you intuitively, I strongly recommend that you read up on just how solid the business case for open source can be without any ideological or developer-empowerment valences.  Read [_Information Rules_](https://books.kemitchell.com/books/information-rules), a kind of short-course in applying traditional economic principles to information goods.  It's twenty years old now, predating the marketing ascendancy of "open source".  Read [_The Cathedral and the Bazaar_](https://books.kemitchell.com/books/cathedral-bazaar), and marvel at just how direct, transparent, and amateurish was the "open source" appeal to business types in its infancy.

<h2 id="fair">This is fair.</h2>
Rewarding the people behind good software is fundamentally fair.  If you make ends meet by charging others to use your software or services, you should expect those whose software and services you use in turn to make ends meet by charging you.

Companies that appeal to fundamental fairness tend to nail the enlightened self-interest point.  Takers should _want_ to reward makers, if makers are good for them.  Compensation problems blow back on production.  If you don't reward software developers fairly, you can expect less good software to use and choose from.  At a very minimum, takers should want to keep makers off desperation's door, where they might be tempted to do something drastic.

But overall, companies haven't tended to tell the fairness story well.  They flub not rational case for fairness, but the moral case or action.  They fail the test of consistency.

A company that wants to invoke fairness on its own behalf doesn't take a superior moral position simply by invoking the Golden Rule.  A company insisting on the fairness for itself---"Amazon should do unto us as Amazon would have its customers do unto Amazon", for example---comes across conniving and hollow without equal mention of the company's own suppliers and dependencies, without mention of what's been done to do right by them.  Frequently, pointing this out leads to a similarly hollow rejoinder:  We will do unto others as we want done unto us ... as soon as we get _our_ checks, and have cash to spare.  That's a big if, and demands a lot of trust.  Our money now.  Your money someday ... maybe ... later.

If the fairness angle appeals to your moral suasion, be prepared to tell _and show_ a consistent moral position.  Practice what you preach before attempting any conversions.

Understand also that you are wading into what is fundamentally a hard, messy labor issue.  Read up on medieval guilds and journeymen associations.  Read up on unions and inter-union relations.  Read up on the professions and antitrust.  Read up on how those institutions fail.

<h2 id="movement">This is a movement.</h2>

If there's one story software people are used to hearing, it's activist protest movement.  The mythos of the Free Software Foundation looms large, even for those who came into open source well after its heyday.

Early free software activists were handsomely rewarded, but not with what they asked for.  Mostly, they were celebrated for byproducts of their activism that hurt as much as helped their own causes.  There is more free and open software at this moment than ever before.  But it is getting harder, not easier, to live a full, connected life without relying on opaque, abusive software systems controlled by others.  Opaque, abusive software systems controlled by others often get built with lots of tools, techniques, and infrastructure "native" to free and open practice.

As a result, the standard for mission-driven credibility has risen.  It's no longer enough to articulate a vision, a struggle, a philosophy, and a project.  One must also demonstrate _strong antibodies_---inbuilt, essential mechanisms that prevent the practice you are trying to overthrow from coopting your work.  Movements that can't play strong defense, in addition to compelling offense, are presumed pointless, and more than a little naive.

Whether it's "software freedom" or "the right to privacy" or "intellectual property" or "decentralization", if a mission-focused story appeals to you, I can't recommend strongly enough that you read about movements in other domains---literally any domain but software.  Read about suffrage and prohibition.  Read about the Sierra Club and the Tea Party.  Read about the American revolution and Rhodesia.  Pay extra attention to when and how things go wrong.

Then read RMS again, and think about how futuristic and idealistic it seems ... after thirty three years of the Free Software Foundation.

## Combos

These stories are not mutually exclusive.  Software history teaches that companies, foundations, and other groups can tell more than one at a time, and that telling more than one is often more than twice as effective.  Just as specific stories may have appealed to you---perhaps activism and fairness, but not business---other stories will appeal to others---perhaps business and fairness, but not activism.  The more stories you can tell in a compelling way, the more folks you can reach with a story they happen to find compelling.

But beware.  History also teaches that it's incredibly difficult to _fake_ any one of these narratives for any meaningful length of time.  Disappointments double:  Falling short of the image you project affects not only how others see your company, from the outside looking in, but how insiders see themselves and the company they work for, from the desk next door.  The way you portray your company will have a lot to do with who and how you hire, and when and how they choose to leave.

The Free Software Foundation has long told a compelling mission-based story.  It has long taken pains, here and there, to emphasize that it isn't against business use of or contribution to free software, and even encourages it.  But their business line, their nods to financial and practical necessity, never felt particularly whole-hearted.  They accede to life's practicalities apologetically or ruefully, not assertively.  They don't want to drive folks coming from the business angle away from free software, but that's not where they come from.

## Experiences

The FSF's flexibility in welcoming business interests without going out of its way to do so points to a fundamental tension in what they call free software, in what most now call open source, and in what may now call open core.  There are definitions and essays and books to read about what free or open source software mean.  But in practice, that's not how we actually learn, any more than we learn what "software" means by reading a Merriam Webster or Wikipedia.  We stumble into open source, or get invited, and have any number of experiences and conversations around it.  Those experiences and conversations become our personal understandings of open source.

Different folks' experiences often overlap, but they are rarely the same.  Open source appeals to different people for different reasons: productivity, politics, camaraderie, efficiency, and so on.  Different experiences also lead to different views and preferences on specific issues, from choice of source code repository to project governance and funding models.  Those differences hide behind the very general notion of open source, which points reliably only to the good thoughts and feelings from our experiences, which we share, and not to any specifics of actual practice, which varies widely.

As a result, open source persists as one of those phrases like "freedom", "community", "liberty", "synergy", and "innovation" with an almost perfectly positive _connotation_, and little if any reliable _denotation_.  When you say "open source", I know I know should feel good about it, but I don't know whether it's permissive or copyleft, community-driven or company-led, in Git on GitHub or in a tarball on an FTP server, in English or Mandarin, monolithic or tiny-modular, Windows-bound or POSIX-compatible, and so on.  Like singing Kum ba yah around a campfire or hearing a stump speech from a politician you already like, when you're feeling the generalities, they can be uplifting, even transcendent.  But when you're not feeling them, the same experience can come across sappy, affected, and more than a little disturbing, especially when everyone else really seems to be into it.

"Open core" accentuates the latent tension between open source feelings and open source practicalities by proximity.  Think "essentially free" or, dare I say it, "community license".  If the marketing value of "open core" is "open", and "open" does work precisely because the difference between open appearance and open reality let us impute some of the former to closed software, then inviting others to recognize the difference risks breaking the spell.  Open core collapsed the very fragile appearance-reality divergence that open core relies on for good marketing bump.

Better, long term, to call open core what it is.  Perhaps "commercial open source".  Perhaps "enterprise pays" or "when you make money, we make money".  Perhaps "public benefit software business".

## Tollbooth

Even if two people who love open source with all their hearts can't be relied on to agree on much of anything specific in an absolute sense, there are definitely trends and heuristics.  From where I'm sitting, one particular archetype of happy open source welcome story has far eclipsed all others in the last ten years: sudden and exhilarating developer empowerment.

Imagine that you set off on a bicycle through a forest park, aiming to summit a large hill in the distance.  A few miles into your journey, you find yourself suddenly not on flat land, but at the crest of an unexpected hill, on the way to your destination.  Heading down the side of this surprise slope, you stop pedaling, and let the grade carry you faster and faster down, freewheel clicking, wind rushing by, all without the slightest effort.  What's more, as you reach the bottom of this surprise hill, you find it ends at the base of the hill you meant to climb.  Carrying momentum from your unexpected descent, you get a massive push up the next climb.

Suddenly discovering you can coast is finding the trove of open source that helps you develop your software project.  Suddenly that project---ascending the hill to your destination---seems far more doable, in less time and with less effort, than you anticipated starting out.  A project that once gave you concern about your abilities, and maybe a twinge of lingering impostor syndrome, now leaves you feeling validated and accomplished.  You still have some pedaling to do.  But the great boost you've been given leaves you feeling, in the moment, like a developer superhero.  With open source, you've got this.

It's a power fantasy.  But for many of us, that fantasy has been very real.

Back in reality, open core companies are busy setting up toll booths at the bottoms of those hills, which they built, and which they maintain every day.  The companies hope that the speed you'll pick up from their free work will make you and your company ready to pay their toll when the time comes, to keep momentum.  Your MVP suddenly needs single sign-on, audit logs, ACLs, and analytics to land a big customer?  Pay, deploy, and go.  New CTO questioning the maturity of your choice of framework?  Time to pony up for that support contract.  The louder you yell "whee!" on the way down, the more and more likely you'll be willing to pay, the companies figure, and the more others will follow.

Open core companies are setting up barricades and taking tolls for reasons that everyone really ought to have seen coming.
