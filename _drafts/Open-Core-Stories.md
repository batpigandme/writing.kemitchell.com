"Open Core" means proprietary software.  We call it "Open Core" to imply the proprietary software comes from an open place.  Proprietary in practice, but open at heart.  Open if we could be, proprietary because we have to be.

When we use "Open Core" as a kind of sheepish apologia, its mute, defensive vibe can strike the right note.  But the louder companies and the industry declare that "Open Core" is a bona fide, established, viable, unapologetic _thing_, the less that note rings true to anyone else.   Declaring for all the world to hear that you are proud of, and defined by, your compromises is not a great story.  No one is inspired to run out and compromise.

If you want to make software, but can't or won't just give it all away for free, and have to hold something back, there are three good stories the industry knows how to hear and tell.  This post is your opportunity to tour them, one by one, decide which appeal to you, and think about the stories you and your company might be able to tell.  Better yet, perhaps you'll come up with a new story of your own.

<h2 id="business">This is a business.</h2>

Rent is reality.  Medical bills are reality.  Retirement costs are reality.  If someone's surprised or offended to find a business lurking behind good software, that's their naivete or simple selfishness acting out, not a righteous rebuke for moral failing or an unfair ambush on your part.  It's not for your company to sweat the Neverland expectations of those who've only just got out of college, or took jobs at large companies that do their best to keep them there.

I strongly suspect that most business folks who find "Open Core" helpful came to the intersection of open and proprietary software from the open direction.  But it's perfectly possible to start from business qua business and work back to some degree of openness by pure deduction, from received business wisdom.  "Freemium" and "loss-leader" strategies---more pejoratively, "bait and switch" or "first hit's free"---show up all over the place, and not just in software.  "Free" as applied to software means "open source".  There you go.

Especially if the business-realist story _doesn't_ appeal to you, I strongly recommend that you read up on just how solid the business case for open source can be without any positive ideological or personal-experience valences.  Read [_Information Rules_](https://books.kemitchell.com/books/information-rules), a kind of short-course in applying traditional economic principles to information goods.  It's twenty years old now---old hat.  Read [_The Cathedral and the Bazaar_](https://books.kemitchell.com/books/cathedral-bazaar), and marvel at just how direct, transparent, and sometimes amateurish was the "open source" appeal to business practicalities.

<h2 id="fair">This is fair.</h2>

Rewarding the people behind good software is fundamentally fair.  If you make ends meet by charging others to use your software or services, you should expect those whose software and services you in turn rely on to make ends meet by charging you. 

Companies that appeal to fundamental fairness tend to nail the enlightened self-interest point square on the head.  Compensation problems blow back on production.  If you don't reward software developers fairly, you can expect less good software to use and choose from.  Users should _want_ to reward producers, if producers are good for them.

When companies tell this story badly, they tend to fall down on consistency instead.  A company that wants to invoke fairness on its own behalf doesn't get a free pass simply by invoking the Golden Rule.  A company insisting on the Golden Rule for itself---Amazon should do unto us as Amazon would have Amazon customers do to Amazon---seems conniving and hollow when it fails to extol the benefits of doing unto its own suppliers and dependencies in the same breath.  Frequently, pointing this out leads to a similarly hollow rejoinder:  We will do unto others as we want done to us ... as soon as we get our money.

If this story appeals to you, understand and accept that you are wading deep into what is fundamentally a labor issue.  Read up on medieval guilds.  Read up on unions.  Read up on the professions.  Read up on how they fail.
