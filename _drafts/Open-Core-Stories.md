"Open Core" means proprietary software.  We call it "Open Core" to imply the proprietary software comes from an open place and open people.  Proprietary in practice, but open at heart.  Open if we could be, but proprietary because we have to be.

When we use "Open Core" as a kind of subtle apologia, its mute, defensive vibe can strike the right note.  But the louder companies and the industry declare that "Open Core" is a bona fide, established, viable, unapologetic _thing_, the less that note rings true to anyone else.   Declaring for all the world to hear that you are proud of, and defined by, your compromises is not a great story.  No one is inspired to run out and compromise.

If you want to make software, but can't or won't just give it all away for free, and have to hold something back, there are three good stories the industry knows how to tell.  This post is going to lay them out for you, one by one.  This is your opportunity to see which ones appeal to you, and which ones you and your company might be able to live out and tell.

## This is a business.

## This is fair.

## This is a movement.
