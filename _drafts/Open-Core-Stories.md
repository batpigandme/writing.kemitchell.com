"Open Core" means proprietary software.  We call it "Open Core" to suggest that proprietary software comes from an open place.  Proprietary in practice, but open at heart.  Open if we could be, proprietary because we have to be.

When we use "Open Core" as a kind of sheepish apologia, its mute, defensive vibe can strike the right tone.  But the louder companies and the industry declare that "Open Core" is a bona fide, established, viable, unapologetic _thing_, the less that note rings true to anyone else.   Declaring for all the world to hear that you are proud of, and defined by, your regrettable compromises is not a great story.  No one is inspired to run out and compromise.

If you want to make software, but can't or won't just give it all away for free, and have to hold something back, there are three good stories the industry knows how to hear and tell.  This post is your opportunity to tour them, one by one, decide which appeal to you, and think about whether you can walk their walk and talk their talk.

Better yet, perhaps you'll come up with a new story of your own.

<h2 id="business">This is a business.</h2>
Rent is reality.  Medical bills are reality.  Retirement costs are reality.  If someone's surprised or offended to find a business lurking behind good software, that's their naivete or simple selfishness acting out, not a righteous rebuke for moral failing or an unfair ambush on your part.  It's not for your company to sweat the Neverland expectations of those who've only just got out of college, or took jobs at large companies that do their best to provide a seamless, infantilizing transition.

I strongly suspect that most business folks who find "Open Core" helpful came to the intersection of open and proprietary from the open side.  But it's perfectly possible to start from business qua business and work back to open by deduction from received business wisdom.  "Freemium" or "loss-leader" strategies---more pejoratively, "bait and switch" or "first hit's free"---show up all over the place, not just in software.  "Free" as applied to software means "open source".  There you go.

Especially if the business-realist story _doesn't_ appeal to you, I strongly recommend that you read up on just how solid the business case for open source can be without any ideological or developer-empowerment valences.  Read [_Information Rules_](https://books.kemitchell.com/books/information-rules), a kind of short-course in applying traditional economic principles to information goods.  It's twenty years old now, predating the marketing ascendancy of "open source".  Read [_The Cathedral and the Bazaar_](https://books.kemitchell.com/books/cathedral-bazaar), and marvel at just how direct, transparent, and amateurish was the "open source" appeal to business types.

<h2 id="fair">This is fair.</h2>
Rewarding the people behind good software is fundamentally fair.  If you make ends meet by charging others to use your software or services, you should expect those whose software and services you use in turn to make ends meet by charging you.

Companies that appeal to fundamental fairness tend to nail the enlightened self-interest point on the head.  Compensation problems blow back on production.  If you don't reward software developers fairly, you can expect less good software to use and choose from.  Users should _want_ to reward producers, if producers are good for them.  At a very minimum, users should want to keep producers off desperation's door, where they might be tempted to do something drastic.

But overall, companies haven't tended to tell the fairness story well.  They fall down on consistency.  A company that wants to invoke fairness on its own behalf doesn't take a superior moral position by just invoking the Golden Rule.  A company insisting on the Golden Rule for itself---Amazon should do unto us as Amazon would have its customers do unto Amazon---seems conniving and hollow when without mention of its own suppliers and dependencies, and what's been done to do right by them.  Frequently, pointing this out leads to a similarly hollow rejoinder:  We will do unto others as we want done to us ... as soon as we get our money.  That's a big if, and begs a lot of trust.

If this story appeals to you, understand and accept that you are wading into a labor issue.  Labor issues are hard, messy issues.  Read up on medieval guilds and journeymen associations.  Read up on unions and inter-union relations.  Read up on the professions and antitrust.  Read up on how those institutions fail.

<h2 id="movement">This is a movement.</h2>

If there's one story software people are used to hearing, it's the story of a rearguard-action social protest movement.  Especially through the mythos of the Free Software Foundation.

Early free software activists were handsomely rewarded, but not with what they asked for.  Mostly, they were celebrated for side effects that hurt as much as helped their causes.  There is more free and open software at this moment than ever before.  But it is getting harder, not easier, to live a full, connected life without relying on opaque, abusive software systems controlled by others.  Opaque, abusive software systems controlled by others often get built with lots of tools, techniques, and infrastructure "native" to free and open practice.

As a result, the bar for claiming mission-driven status has risen.  It's no longer enough to articulate a vision, a struggle, a philosophy, and a program.  All of the above must demonstrate _strong antibodies_, inbuilt, essential mechanisms capable of forestalling cooptation.  A movement has to demonstrate an ability to play strong defense.

Whether it's software freedom or user privacy or anti-intellectual property or decentralization, if a mission-focused story appeals to you, I can't recommend strongly enough that you read about movements in other domains ... outside of software.  Read about suffrage and prohibition.  Read about the Sierra Club and the Tea Party.  Read about the American revolution and Rhodesia.  Pay extra attention to when things went wrong.

These stories are not mutually exclusive.  Software history teaches that, too.
