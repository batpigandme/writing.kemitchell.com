I started working life as a computer programmer.  I've read, and own, the classics of cryptography.  Bought 'em when "crypto" still meant "cryptography".

And I'm a deals lawyer.  I'm in the game for the hard problems.  New modes of collaborating and sharing profit are long, long overdue.  I'm not here to fill out forms.  Let the computers do it.

So of course I wanted blockchain clients.  And I worked with some of the best.  The adults in the room.  But I'm out now.  No more.

The money, the speculative money, the easy money, is a black hole.  It
has bent space, time, and judgment.  It doesn't matter how much integrity you have.  No matter how much lust for the real problems, the promise of distributed consensus.  Resisting the depthless gravity of the money is more than honor can demand.  People are squishy.  Even the best will bend.  Everything bends.  Toward the money.
