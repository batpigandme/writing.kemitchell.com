title: Some Success
---

Technical people derive more meaning from connecting their technical work to big ideas.

Stallman connected his work to software freedom.

ESR connected open source to libertarianism.

But any technology that succeeds by _scale_ inherently scales by reaching out and serving people who don't share those views.

In time, all of the proponents of technical innovations who tie their esteem to more general, philosophical or social messages come to disappointment.  They find out that the new and useful ideas they have can be divorced from the broader political, social, or intellectual programs of their dreams.
