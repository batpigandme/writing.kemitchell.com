Software people tend to assume that everybody loves open source, or would if they got the chance.  After all, who doesn't like free stuff?  Who doesn't like freedom?

What they often miss is how differently not-software people see the term and receive all the preachy enthusiasm for it.  From outside software looking in, "software freedom" walks and quacks a lot more like "coder entitlement".  The theme: a hacker on a tear should never hear the word "no".  Not when breaking into offices to steal parts for a train set.  Not when contending with a printer they never worked on or paid for.  Not when building the next hot web or mobile app ... again.  Not when building the war cloud or hooking grandma on photo-tag dopamine.

All of this with heaping spoonfuls of coder flattery, to boot.  Coders as indomitable "innovators".  Coders as righteous "[disrupters](http://claytonchristensen.com/key-concepts/)".  Coders as [kingmakers](https://thenewkingmakers.com/).  Coders [eating the (business) world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/).  Coders as pious priesthood of the Internet miracle, taking dominion over the world like the friars took California.

What coders tend to miss amongst all this frantic ego stroking is that the marketing machine never stopped.  "Open Source" was a tremendous gap-filler on the balance sheets of early-2000s great tech company expectations.  _Something_ accounted for [VA Linux' valuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geeknet#Initial_public_offering), not to mention its willingness to [share some to spinmeisters](https://news.slashdot.org/story/99/12/10/0821224/esr-writes-on-surprised-by-wealth), at least before [ephemerality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LNUX.png) came back to bite.  Then Red Hat's [valuation](https://www.cnet.com/news/red-hat-shares-triple-in-ipo/), and [GitHub's](https://hbr.org/2018/06/why-microsoft-is-willing-to-pay-so-much-for-github), and Red Hat's [again](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-closes-landmark-acquisition-red-hat-34-billion-defines-open-hybrid-cloud-future).  Always with a tinge of resistance and resentment, as the mantle passes to the next hot firm crafty enough to take it, leaving the prior emperor visibly disrobed.

"Open Source" hasn't depreciated to nil quite yet.  But the business world did not stop minting new buzzwords, just 'cause that one's still got life.  And curiously, given the all-encompassing dominion over software that "open source" represents, the new hot words and phrases have tended to _reject_ coder dominion and the universality of "free" and "open" explicitly.  In explicitly negative terms.

Three for the record:  No Software.  No Code.  No Logs.

## No Software

"No Software", the famous slogan of Salesforce, never actually meant no software.  It meant Salesforce would keep and run the software for you, so you didn't have to do it yourself, or find some coder to do it for you.  You don't have to see the sausage made, delivered, or prepared.  You just get to eat it.

As it turns out, coders and their ilk are basically the only people who feel good, or anything but inconvenience, about installing copies of code on computers.  Others bear the chore begrudgingly, only as a necessary means to an end.  For example, when software they need simply isn't available any other way, or when practicalities like performance require local copies, as for games.  But given the choice, normal human beings don't want to install anything at all.  They don't want to handle downloads.  They don't want to handle upgrades.  They don't want to handle license keys.  They don't want to handle backups.  They definitely don't want to squint at system requirements, or understand them.  Even under the guiding hand of an app store.  They dislike these things more than paying money.  Paying money is incredibly easy these days.

If, as a music listener, you've slowly given up ripping, cataloging, and backing up your music collection from physical media, because you can just stream it all, you know exactly where non-coders are coming from.  You want to listen to music.  Unless acquiring, cataloging, and handling music became _your thing_, it's not the point.  Spotify doesn't threaten your freedom, your autonomy, or your dignity.  It's just better.

In the same vein, unless you're a committed gearhead, you probably don't care to change the oil in your own car, drive a manual transmission without power steering, or even necessarily own a car.  In urban areas, you may simply prefer to hail rides when you need them.  The auto makers are onto this, even among those who want a car at their own beck and call.  Subscription-based auto ["memberships"](https://www.accessbybmw.com/) are coming.

Call No Software "service bureau".  Call it "application service provider".  Call it "software as a service".  Call it "cloud".  Call it Jemimah.  Business rejected open source's obsession with possessing the goods and pretending independence, pitched that affront as an anti-technocrat rebellion, and built the tallest tower phallus in San Francisco.  Much has been written about open source and SaaS.  But the simple fact is, as a phenomenon and a brand, open source never cogently responded.  _Being_ "open source" and building closed SaaS coexists fine with "No Software", because each is addressed to a different audience.
