<!-- Developers cost a lot. ->

<!-- There is a shortage in programming education. -->

<!-- Everything done well looks simple on the outside. -->

<!-- All developers come motivation-included? -->

<!-- Not all problems are fun, sexy, or meet programmers' needs. -->

<!-- This is a double-edged sword, and applies, if at all, as well to what the arguer is making. -->
