What's going on with new open software license terms for businesses?

[Redis Labs has some.](https://redislabs.com/community/licenses/)  [Vespene, too.](https://medium.com/@michaeldehaan/going-with-the-commons-clause-1bdab4c15e5d)  [Mongo did its own.](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license)  [I'm busy drafting.](https://licensezero.com/licenses#public)   [A spiffy new "commercial open source" VC firm wants even more.](https://changelog.com/podcast/320)  Why?

Once again, the two great camps of copyleft license developers---software freedom activists and competitive upstarts---have come apart.  Business users of strong copyleft licenses are writing the new licenses, for themselves, that their erstwhile activist allies aren't willing to write for them.  That loss of cohesion on the copyleft side, uncorrected, threatens to further imbalance open source as a whole toward permissive licenses, and the interests of those who choose them.  That lopsidedness, in turn, threatens the to topple the unity that makes the movement as a whole broad-based.

Business firms and small players have written new, demanding licenses as long as they've said "open source", and nearly as long as they've said "free software".  Historically, new terms of the kind act as a signal, triggering self-correcting mechanisms within copyleft license design, on the activist side, to respond to developments in the broader world of software practice and the software industry.  We are seeing the signal.  But also signs that activist and business copyleft developers won't reunify under a single set of terms.

Even newcomers know that open software can be permissive or copyleft, and both count as open source.  But that has never been the whole story.  Reasons for those license choices vary more than one-or-the-other licensing suggests.  Licenses implement functionality, as software implements functionality.  Software producers choose permissive or copyleft implementations to achieve different goals, not just in resulting relationships between producers and consumers, but in relationships between producers, as well.

## Permissive

The permissive license developer community comprises two recognizable camps.

The BSD School of hackerdom rejects intellectual property and the transactional hassles it imposes.  Ideally, BSD School hackers wouldn't need or use licenses at all.  Software would simply be free to use, change, share, and so on.  Short permissive licenses like BSD, MIT, and ISC offer the closest practical approximation.

Meanwhile, established and well capitalized businesses seek free passage through the red tape that keeps software from passing firm to firm.  Ideally, software that these permissive developers provide as loss leaders, share to defray development costs, or popularize for strategic advantage would be easily adopted by potential customers and contributors, especially established and well capitalized ones.  Permissive licenses like Apache 2.0 come as close as possible to zero friction in corporate exchange of software.

Both BSD School hackers and established businesses choose permissive licenses.  But their differences of purpose show through in various ways.

Radical factions of the BSD School choose stripped-down versions of old academic licenses like 0BSD and Unlicense, or even grating antilicenses like WTFPL.  The tone and the content of those licenses scare some established business users and contributors away.

Established businesses prefer contract-style licenses  that lawyers, sometimes only lawyers, can read.  They particularly like licenses with robust patent terms, including defensive termination provisions that give them back their rights to sue under patents in a standoff.  Length, style, and patent terms rankle BSD School hackers, who like things short, despise software patents, and decry businesses for acquiring them.

BSD School hackers reject the very legal and contractual regimes that make most established software company business models possible.  Established businesses abide BSD School hackers' insistence on openness, until it comes to the software they sell.  But both BSD School hackers and established businesses want open source licenses that reverse legal defaults that restrict work with software and source code.

Despite this fundamental tension, the coalition of permissive license developer groups remains pretty strong.

## Copyleft

The copyleft license developer community also comprises two broad camps.

Free software activists reject closed software as an ethical affront.  Ideally, free software activists wouldn't need copyleft licenses at all.  Source code would always be available, free to use, change, share, and so on.  Copyleft licenses like AGPL and GPL come as close as possible, by preventing companies from closing open code, at least when software freedom philosophy says they should not.

Meanwhile, competitive upstarts seek free access to open infrastructure and collaboration in their quests to establish projects and create opportunity.  Ideally, everyone who uses their work would contribute back, and those contributions wouldn't simply play into the hands of their competitors.  Very strong copyleft or "reciprocal" licenses written by businesses, like RPL and OSL, come as close as possible, by requiring sharing work back as open software in the maximum number of cases.  This their competitors will not be willing to do.  But until recently, upstarts almost uniformly chose strong copyleft licenses written by activists, especially AGPL and GPL, instead.

Both software freedom activists and competitive upstarts choose copyleft licenses.  But we see their underlying differences reflected in various ways.

The most important free software activist organization, the Free Software Foundation, expounds a complex, esoteric, deeply contrarian code of ethics.  That self-styled philosophy shows through in its licenses.  The FSF's preachy preambles and self-imposed limits on how strong copyleft rules can be rankle competitive upstarts who don't subscribe to the ideology.  But upstarts often begrudgingly accept those shortcomings in activist licenses, sometimes to reap the benefit of license-compatible network effects, and sometimes for simple inability to write and socialize their own legal terms.

Software freedom activists look on upstarts' pragmatism and competitiveness with unease.  They worry about upstarts who use copyleft to give themselves privileged positions in projects, and somewhat begrudgingly accept the use of their licenses for "dual licensing", or selling private permission to build copyleft code into closed software.  For software freedom activists, copyleft is a means to software freedom, an invitation to what's right, not a tool for excluding others and taking pay for a pass to do what's wrong.

Software freedom activists reject the license-based power dynamics that competitive upstarts need.  Competitive upstarts feel dragged into sanctimonious moralizing and labyrinthine mysteries of GPL exegesis.  Both software freedom activists and competitive upstarts want license terms that require sharing back.

Despite underlying tensions no more fundamental than those within the permissive license user community, the coalition of copyleft license users is coming apart.  Why?

## Open Source

Ask people affiliated with the Open Source Initiative about free software, and many will tell you that open source isn't really any different.  Free software just preached too much fire and brimstone, missed the rebrand, and lost out for future relevance.

Ask folks affiliated with the Free Software Foundation about open source, and many will jump to tell just how different they are.  Open source strips free software of its values, pandering to the nonfree industry with promises of better, cheaper code, which doesn't happen without unifying community spirit.

That is the popular narrative of the birth of "open source" and the wooing of big business to the scene.  It's a story told from the perspectives of name-brand protagonists---OSI and FSF---and their partisans.  Not the users of free software and open source licenses.

Bringing open source to business, and business to open source, has been a process of long, slow, and occasionally sudden progress.  Since setting up the Open Source Initiative and coining "open source", decisions have been altogether less dramatic, more mixed, more organic.  Change had more to do with changes outside the organizations, and the medium- and long-term effects of many small steps, than dashing, newsworthy gambits.

## Cohesion

In that history, we can see the software freedom activist and competitive upstart camps of copyleft users draw apart and come back together, in cycles.

In the end, the Open Source Initiative has approved every major license published by the Free Software Foundation.  Both organizations have approved copyleft licenses drafted by non-activists, without free software rhetoric, from Sleepycat forward.  But fairly early in its history, circa 2002, OSI and FSF split on a particular kind of license: strong copyleft or "reciprocal" terms, drafted by companies and company-minded lawyers in business-law style, ignoring FSF's self-imposed limits on how much code copyleft could require sharing back, and when.

Relatively few of these licenses achieved lasting popularity.  Several served as waystations for the companies, and the specific software, for which they were drafted, on their way, eventually, to FSF-drafted terms.  Indeed, the business reciprocal licenses fall well short of perfection, in many aspects.  But some remain the strongest choices for drawing patches back.  Some remain the most robust choices for closing the "ASP loophole", alias "SaaS loophole" or "Google problem".

In time, the Free Software Foundation succeeded in bringing many competitive upstarts back into its fold with the Affero GPL.  Affero closed the loophole that allowed closed software to be made from GPL code, as long as the resulting program was run to provide a network service, rather than sent to users for them to run for themselves.  However, staunch resistance and fork threats kept the FSF from merging its new, stronger AGPL terms into GPL at the next major update, version 3.  All the same, AGPLv3 was widely taken as the latest, most robust implementation of the activist spec: a license that makes software available for use in free software, but not in proprietary software.  The more radical software freedom activists speak of AGPLv3 as the "real" GPLv3 to this day.

Once again, competitive upstarts who couldn't afford to draft and propose their own licenses repurposed a good-enough activist license, AGPLv3, for strong copyleft terms to meet their needs.  Many of these projects, as it turns out, used little or no other GPLv3 or AGPLv3 software, forgoing the benefit of license compatibility, in part because they insisted on licensing their whole programs also on commercial terms.  GPLv3 or AGPLv3 dependencies written by others would not allow them to do.  The point was keeping competitors out, not jumping in with activist developers.  Though of course activist allies in holding the license out as open didn't hurt.

But AGPLv3 inherited many of the same self-imposed limitations and complexities of FSF licensing.  For a time, those flaws remained practically irrelevant.  Closed software companies dutifully placed AGPL code on their ban lists for internal consumption, in some cases by reputation alone.  If they used such software, they did so under alternative, commercial licenses bought straight from the developers.  Thus, AGPLv3 was, for a brief span of time, a truly bona fide and "free for free software" license in practice.  But only in practice.

As the value of software under AGPL grew, so did incentives to find new loopholes, new ways for competitors to use AGPL software in nonfree software, and in competition with its developers.  As with GPLv2 before it, AGPLv3's copyleft functionality created a de facto bug bounty: first to find a loophole through wins a second-mover advantage with the code.  AGPLv3's scope, length, and complexity are just that much more attack surface.  The interest of large firms with excellent legal counsel brought talent to problem.  The enterprise cracked the activists' license.  Again.

That is the complaint we hear from some upstarts welcoming new licenses.  Some of the new terms, like Commons Clause, eschew the complexity of copyleft and open source neutrality by writing direct prohibitions on what their competitors are doing that they don't want to allow.  MongoDB's Server Side Public License, reflecting capacity to field much more legal time and talent, strengthens copyleft, relying on a requirement to share code back, to exclude proprietary software companies who happen to be competitors.

## Commercial

But that's not all that's going on in the new licenses.  Their competitor-excluding terms aren't just stronger, at their outer limits, but also more targeted, more selective.

Both Commons Clause and SSPL attempt to carve out permissive-license safe zones within otherwise strong commercial-use or copyleft rules.  Both aim to allow continued use of applications, especially databases, as integrated in broader proprietary applications, like web applications, while simultaneously restricting or requiring service offerings of those applications to be made open.  In other words, loosely: permissive for users integrating into applications, restricted or strong-copyleft for everybody else.

A copyleft license that does that clearly and effectively would afford best-of-all-worlds for some developers, offering a passport to broad corporate adoption, the established business benefit of a permissive terms, a competitor-excluding "open for open source" rule, the competitive upstart benefit of strong copyleft, plus a clear claim to "open source" status.  The trick is setting the scope of the copyleft terms precisely, to allow the uses the developer wants, and require sharing back for uses they don't.

Such an approach spans permissive and copyleft user groups selectively.  It caters to the business user camp, not the activist camp, on each side.  BSD School hackers will not want even more complex half-copyleft licenses.  Software freedom advocates will not want morally blinkered, half-permissive licenses.  SSPL isn't out to please those constituencies, and it won't.

## Conflict

There's inherent tension in the new, theoretical coalition of commercial open source, as well.  A basic business conflict of interest.

Many of the firms rushing to adopt new, selectively competitor-excluding terms do so to protect themselves against incumbent software companies with insurmountable business advantages.  Database developers, for example, grasp for defensive measures against platform-as-a-service providers offering their work on a hosted basis.  Those incumbent cloud providers develop permissively licensed software, albeit highly selectively, to drive demand for paid products and services, create strategic advantage, and spread maintenance costs.  They also consume permissively licensed software voraciously.  At least short term, those incumbent software companies would really rather have databases and such under permissive licenses, thank you very much.

A license experiment like Commons Clause sparks far less interest, historically and theoretically, for openly departing from open source practice.  That's expedient:  Getting the license functionality you want is a lot easier if you can just write the uses you don't want to license, restrict them, and not worry about open source.  But in the ongoing dialog between competitive upstarts and established companies in software, those terms serve an indispensable signaling purpose.

Companies adopting Commons Clause, clumsy, strange, and hackish as it may be, demonstrate that they won't succumb to pressure to license permissively, stay on terms that afford incumbents loopholes, or forgo the benefits of open development.  They'll take the community heat from BSD School hackers.  They'll take the heat from software freedom activists.  And they'll take the heat from open source gatekeepers, notably the Open Source Initiative, which counts all three major platform-as-a-service providers among its marquee sponsors.  These voices ask:  Why won't these companies listen to us?  The real answer is:  These companies aren't talking to you.  They're talking past you, to each other.

Establishing that competitive upstarts will stand their ground secures a platform for the one argument that could bring established software businesses over into a mixed permissive-copyleft, small-to-huge-business, "commercial open source" coalition: enlightened self-interest.  Isn't it good for established software business, long term, to ensure upstarts access to a ready mix of community development benefits and leverage to command financial compensation, or force them to pick one or the other?  Wouldn't ready access to both produce more valuable software for established providers to hock through their own gated platforms and marketplaces?

Commons Clause is a stick.  SSPL is a carrot.  Incumbent software companies have bought the enlightened self-interest argument before.  It's how they ended up on the OSI website to begin with.

## Reconciliation

A new commercial coalition in open source, operating at the same level as the permissive and copyleft coalitions we've known so far, would be something largely new, at scale, a new chapter in open source history.  If we wanted to bet on prior record, instead, we'd take reconciliation within the copyleft coalition.

In other words, a new, even stronger copyleft license that both software freedom activists and competitive upstarts could get behind.  Probably another FSF patch to AGPL, like SSPL, but a patch that the activist community could conceivably make its own, as the Affero GPL became the GNU Affero GPL.

There is cause for doubt, in the details.

I don't think the FSF is of any mind to write a radically strong copyleft license.  More and more, the FSF has constrained itself to soft power, emphasized reconciliation over enforcement, declined to make punitive examples, and accepted praise, attention, and stewardship of key but aging projects, instead of doubling down and drawing lines.  Doctrinally, they've stuck to dogma on license implementation, notably freedom 0 absolutism and private changes, that bind their drafters' hands to solve problems more robustly.  In a word, the FSF and its community have become more conciliatory, more esoteric, more insular with age.  It's a young, angry movement where widespread computing, and software freedom, are new.  But only there.

More concretely, the FSF doesn't share upstart business concern with the widening cracks and crevices of AGPLv3, as it once shared its concern with the gaping ASP loophole.  FSF partisans point to activist users of AGPLv3, as it stands now, and see nothing wrong.  In large part because activist projects under AGPL don't offer nearly the bounty value that upstart projects do.  They have succeeded largely within the activist community, and not on the broader scale of open source as a whole.  And in large part because activist AGPLv3 developers don't care about excluding business competitors.  Their needs are different, and they feel they're being met.  After all, the license was written for those needs.

That's not to say there's no hunger for a streamlined, radical copyleft license among activists.  There is, and no little frustration with the compromises FSF has made.  But here the cross-cutting nature of the new business-oriented licenses comes into play.  I don't perceive any activist demand for the peculiar combination of permissiveness and copyleft, and the specific line drawn between them, that upstart open source database developers crave.  When software freedom activists want a permissive license, they use Apache 2.0.  In vanishing edge cases, they use LGPL.  The FSF position on "service as a software substitute" is that it's pernicious.  Why would activists want a license that allows making free code nonfree for the good kind of software---software you run for yourself---and requires keeping free code free for the bad kind---services substituting for real software?

Overall, I'm sad to say that I think FSF's compromises are catching up with it, cutting it off from the allies it needs now, more than ever.  Software freedom activism has trusted that purity of message will create a groundswell of support sufficient to address permissive clones, broad shifts in software delivery, and the relegation of openness to tooling, the back-end, and building blocks for proprietary end-user applications.  Unless or until this reality comes to be felt as a crisis, and not just understood as one, I don't think software freedom, through FSF or otherwise, has a stronger license in it to give.

## Radicalism

Where does all this leave everybody who _isn't_ at a big company, and doesn't want to be?  What about the independent developers, small teams, and bootstrapper businesses also struggling to sustain?

My own experiments in strong copyleft licensing, embodied in [Parity](https://licensezero.com/licenses/parity), have tried to point the way for a new, radical copyleft license.  And to do so in a way more responsive to the needs, tastes, and valid points of the BSD School.

Simplicity is key.  Simplicity, eschewing compromise, becomes radical.

Using such a license to protect an upstart commercial venture.
