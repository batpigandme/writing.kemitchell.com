What's going on with new software license terms for businesses?

[Redis Labs has some.](https://redislabs.com/community/licenses/)  [Neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j), [Dgraph](https://blog.dgraph.io/post/relicensing-dgraph/), and [Vespene](https://medium.com/@michaeldehaan/going-with-the-commons-clause-1bdab4c15e5d), too.  [Mongo did its own.](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license)  [I've done two.](https://licensezero.com/licenses#public)   [A spiffy new "commercial open source" VC firm wants even more of them.](https://changelog.com/podcast/320)  Why?

The two great camps of copyleft developers---software freedom activists and competitive upstarts---have drifted apart again.  Upstarts can no longer achieve their goals with FSF-stewarded, activist-drafted copyleft licenses.  Activists remain largely satisfied with their terms.  So upstart copyleft developers are writing the new terms their erstwhile activist allies won't write with them.

That loss of cohesion---upstarts abandoning activist licenses, activists opposing upstart alternatives---threatens the balance that keeps the greater open source movement broad-based.  Permissive developers, riding a decade of adoption success and wary of copyleft to begin with, wonder now more than ever whether why they abide copyleft complexity and copyleft politics.  Permissive points register all the more strongly, since copyleft developers are too busy arguing with each other to answer them.

None of this is new.  Open-leaning software businesses have written new, more demanding licenses as long there's been "open source", and nearly as long as there's been "free software".  Historically, new terms of the kind act as a signal, triggering self-stabilizing mechanisms on the activist side, to patch and strengthen their copyleft terms.  We are seeing the signal.  But also signs that activist and business copyleft developers may not reunify under a single set of shared terms this time around.

## Parties

Even newcomers know that open source can be permissive, or it can be copyleft.  But that has never been the whole story.  Reasons for those license choices vary.  Software producers choose permissive or copyleft licenses to achieve different goals, not just in resulting relationships between the producer and their consumers, but in relationships between the producer and other producers, as well.

To understand the new terms, we need to understand the producer needs they address.  To understand what the new terms say about the opens source movement, we need to see that movement for what it is: a coalition of diverse interests, beliefs, and goals. 

## Permissive

The permissive license developer party comprises two historic wings.

The BSD school of hackerdom rejects intellectual property and the transactional hassles it imposes.  Ideally, BSD school hackers wouldn't need or use licenses at all.  Intellectual property laws affecting software would be struck from the books, leaving software free do use, change, share, and so on.  Short permissive licenses like BSD, MIT, and ISC offer the closest practical approximation.

Meanwhile, established and well capitalized businesses seek free passage through the red tape that keeps software siloed in firms.  Ideally, software provided as a loss leader, shared to defray development costs, or popularized for strategic advantage would be gracefully and immediately adopted by potential customers and contributors.  Permissive licenses like Apache 2.0 minimize friction in corporate software exchange.

Both BSD school hackers and established businesses choose permissive licenses.  But their differences of purpose show through in various ways.

Radical BSD school hackers choose stripped-down versions of old academic licenses like 0BSD and Unlicense, grating antilicenses like WTFPL, and bare assertions that their code is public domain.  The tone and the content of those terms scare many established business users and contributors away.

Established businesses prefer contract-style licenses that lawyers, and often only lawyers, can read.  They particularly like licenses with robust patent terms, like defensive termination provisions that give them back their rights to sue under patents in a standoff.  Length, style, and patent terms rankle BSD school hackers, who like short licenses, despise software patents, and decry firms that seek them.

BSD school hackers reject the very legal and contractual regimes that make most established software company business models possible.  Established businesses abide BSD school hackers' insistence on openness, until it comes to the software they sell.

But both BSD school hackers and established businesses want open source licenses that reverse legal defaults that otherwise restrict software.  Despite fundamental underlying tension, the coalition of permissive license developer groups remains pretty strong.

## Copyleft

The copyleft developer party also comprises two discernible wings.

Free software activists reject closed software as an ethical affront.  Ideally, free software activists wouldn't need copyleft licenses at all.  The law would mandate that all software be free.  Copyleft licenses like AGPL and GPL come as close as possible, by preventing companies from locking up free software, at least some of the time.

Meanwhile, competitive upstarts seek free access to open infrastructure and collaboration in their quests to become established.  Ideally, everyone who uses their work would contribute back, and those contributions wouldn't simple play into the hands of competitors.  Very strong copyleft or "reciprocal" licenses written by businesses, like RPL, come as close as possible, by requiring users to share the most own work back.

Both software freedom activists and competitive upstarts choose copyleft licenses.   In fact, in recent years, upstarts have most often used repurposed activist licenses, like AGPL and GPL.  But their underlying differences show through.

The most important free software activist organization, the Free Software Foundation, expounds a complex, esoteric code of licensing ethics.  That self-styled philosophy marks its licenses.  FSF forms sport long, preachy preambles.  Their copyleft rules mind self-imposed handicaps on how strong copyleft should be.  But upstarts often accept those shortcomings.  Sometimes to reap the benefit of license-compatible network effects.  Sometimes for simple inability to write and socialize shorter, stronger copyleft terms of their own.

Software freedom activists regard upstarts' pragmatism and competitiveness with unease.  They worry about upstarts who use copyleft to give themselves privileged positions in projects, and begrudgingly accept their use of activist licenses for "dual licensing", or selling private permission to build nonfree software with copyleft code.  For software freedom activists, copyleft is a means to software freedom, an invitation to do right, not a tool for excluding others and charging to do wrong.

Software freedom activists reject the asymmetric, license-based power dynamics that upstarts seek for defense against established competitors.  Competitive upstarts feel dragged into sanctimonious moralizing and lost in the General Public Labyrinth.

In the end, both software freedom activists and competitive upstarts want license terms that require sharing back.  Underlying tension between activists and upstarts are no more fundamental than between the BSD school and established companies.  But the copyleft party is coming apart at the seam.

## Open Source

Ask people affiliated with the Open Source Initiative about free software, and many will tell you that it isn't really any different.  Free software just preached too much fire and brimstone, missed the rebrand, and lost mindshare.

Ask folks affiliated with the Free Software Foundation about open source, and many will jump to tell just how different it is.  Open source strips free software of its values, pandering to the nonfree industry with promises of better, cheaper code, which doesn't happen without unifying community spirit.

That is the popular narrative of the birth of open source and the wooing of big business to the scene.  It's a story told from the perspectives of name-brand protagonists---OSI and FSF---and their partisans.  Not the users of free software and open source licenses.

Bringing open source to business, and business to open source, has been a process of long, slow, occasionally sudden progress.  Since setting up the Open Source Initiative and coining "open source", decisions have been altogether less dramatic, more mixed, more organic.  Change had more to do with changes outside community organizations, in the community, and the medium- and long-term effects of many small steps, rather than dashing, newsworthy gambits.

## Cohesion

In that more nuanced history, we can see the software freedom activist and competitive upstart factions of the copyleft party draw apart and come back together.

In the end, the Open Source Initiative has approved every major license published by the Free Software Foundation.  Both organizations have approved copyleft licenses drafted by non-activists, free of free software rhetoric, from Sleepycat on.  But fairly early in open source history, circa 2002, OSI and FSF split on a particular kind of license: strong copyleft or "reciprocal" terms, drafted by companies and company-minded lawyers in business-law style, ignoring FSF's self-imposed limits on how much code copyleft could require sharing back, and when.  For a time, OSI became the institutional home of strong copyleft, approving licenses that met competitive upstart needs, but ignored FSF's software freedom constraints.

Relatively few of these licenses achieved lasting popularity.  Several served as waystations for the specific companies, and even the specific software, for which they were drafted, on their way to GPL relicensing, later on.  Indeed, the business reciprocal licenses fall well short of perfection.  But some remain the strongest choices for drawing patches back.  Some remain the most robust choices for closing the "ASP loophole", alias "SaaS loophole" or "Google problem".

Accommodation of upstart competitors tracks much of the seminal writing in the early years of the Open Source Initiative.  Part of achieving business acceptance of open source was putting open source's merits in loosely economic, business terms.  To break the reputation link between "open source" and noncommercial, or even anti-commercial attitudes, it helped mightily to theorize and demonstrate how open source could augment existing business models, or even power business models of its own.  Before big companies flocked to the free and open source buffet, smaller companies, especially engineer-driven software firms where programmers with deep open community ties held broad authority, were hard at work in the kitchen.

In time, the Free Software Foundation succeeded in bringing many upstarts back into its fold with the Affero GPL.  Affero closed the loophole that allowed closed software to be made from GPL code if the resulting program was run to provide a network service, rather than sent to users for them to run for themselves.  However, outcry and fork threats kept the FSF from merging its new, stronger terms into mainline GPL at the next major update, version 3.  That made it easy to isolate AGPL as an aberration, an extremist diversion.  At the same time, AGPL was immediately recognized as the latest, most robust implementation of the activist license functional specification: a license that makes software available for use in free software, but not in proprietary software.  Many activists speak of AGPL as the real GPLv3 to this day.

Once again, competitive upstarts who couldn't afford to draft and propose their own licenses adopted a good-enough activist license to meet their needs.  Many of these projects, it turns out, used little or no other GPLv3 or AGPLv3 software, forgoing the benefit of license compatibility, in part because they insisted on licensing their whole programs also on commercial terms.  The point was keeping competitors out, not jumping in with the activists.  But upstarts welcomed allies in defending the new, stronger license as free and open source, and activists welcomed the support.  In the end, a company took AGPLv3 to the Open Source Initiative for approval, not the Free Software Foundation.

AGPLv3 inherited many of the same self-imposed limitations and complexities of Free Software Foundation licensing.  But for a time, those flaws didn't matter.  Closed software companies dutifully banned AGPLv3 for internal consumption by corporate policy, in many cases on strength of reputation alone.  If they used AGPLv3 software, they did so under alternative, commercial licenses bought from the upstarts.  Thus, AGPLv3 was, for a brief span, both a bona fide open source license and a functional "free for free software" license in practice.  But only in practice.

As the value of software under AGPLv3 grew, so did incentives to find new loopholes, new ways for competitors to use AGPLv3 code in nonfree offerings.  As with GPLv2 before it, AGPLv3's copyleft functionality created a de facto bug bounty: first big company to find a loophole wins first-established-mover advantage with the code.  AGPLv3's scope, length, and complexity made just that much more attack surface.  The attention of large firms put savvy legal counsel---the bounty hunters---on the hunt.

Enterprise legal cracked the activists' license again.  That is the complaint we hear from some upstarts with new, stronger licenses.  Some of the new terms, like Commons Clause, eschew the complexity of copyleft and open source neutrality by writing direct prohibitions on what their competitors are doing that they don't want to allow.  MongoDB's Server Side Public License, reflecting capacity to field much more legal time and talent, strengthens copyleft, relying on a requirement to share code back to exclude competitors who service-ize the software.

## Commercial

But that's not all that's going on in the new licenses.  Their competitor-excluding terms aren't just stronger, at their outer limits, but also targeted, selective.

Both Commons Clause and SSPL attempt to carve out permissive-license safe zones within otherwise strong commercial-use or copyleft rules.  Both aim to allow continued use of applications, especially databases, as integrated in broader proprietary applications, like web applications, while simultaneously restricting or requiring service offerings of those applications to be made open.  In other words, loosely: permissive for users making applications, restricted or strong-copyleft for users offering as a service.

A hybrid license that achieves that split clearly and effectively would afford best-of-both-class functionality for the companies joining on, offering a passport to broad corporate adoption, the established business benefit of a permissive terms, plus a competitor-excluding "open for open source" rule, the competitive upstart benefit of strong copyleft.  All with a strong claim to continue "open source" status and its benefits.  The trick is setting the scope of the copyleft terms precisely, to permit users the developer welcomes and require maximum reciprocity from users they fear.  Not to mention arguing for community acceptance.

Such an approach spans permissive and copyleft user groups selectively.  It caters to the business wings, not the activist factions, of permissive and copyleft parties.  BSD school hackers will not want even more complex half-copyleft licenses.  Software freedom advocates will not want morally blinkered, half-permissive licenses.  SSPL isn't out to please those factions, and it won't.

## Conflict

There's inherent tension in the new, theoretical commercial open source party, as well.  A basic business conflict of interest.

Many of the firms rushing to adopt new, selectively competitor-excluding terms do so to protect themselves against incumbent software companies with insurmountable business advantages.  Database developers, for example, grasp for defensive measures against platform-as-a-service providers offering their work on a hosted basis.  Those incumbent cloud providers develop permissively licensed software, also selectively, to drive demand for paid products and services, create strategic advantage, and spread maintenance costs.  They also consume permissively licensed software voraciously.  At least short term, incumbent software companies would like their databases permissive, or busted copyleft, thank you very much.

An experiment like Commons Clause sparks far less interest, historically and theoretically, for openly departing from open source practice.  It's expedient.  Getting the license functionality you want is a lot easier if you can just write the use cases you don't want to license, restrict them, and not worry about open source has to say about it.  But in the ongoing dialog between competitive upstarts and established companies in software, those terms serve an indispensable signaling function.

Companies adopting Commons Clause---clumsy, strange, and hackish as it may be---demonstrate that they won't succumb to pressure to license permissively, accept the limits of activist copyleft licenses, or forgo the benefits of open development.  They'll take the community heat from BSD school hackers.  They'll take the heat from software freedom activists.  And they'll take the heat from self-appointed gatekeepers, notably the Open Source Initiative, which counts all three major platform-as-a-service providers among its marquee sponsors.  These voices ask:  Why won't these companies listen us?  The answer:  These companies aren't talking to you.  They're talking to each other, and to their competitors.

Establishing that competitive upstarts will stand their ground secures a platform for the one argument that could bring established software businesses over into a new, permissive-copyleft-hybrid, pan-business, "commercial open source" party: enlightened self-interest.  Isn't it good for established software business, long term, to ensure upstarts access to community development benefits and financial compensation?  Wouldn't ready access to both produce more valuable software for established providers to hock through their platforms and marketplaces?

Commons Clause is an entrenching tool.  SSPL is an peace treaty.  Incumbent software companies have bought the enlightened self-interest argument before.  It's how they ended up on the OSI website to begin with.  But they're also far more concerned with competition among themselves, to establish cloud computing positions, than with relatively microscale suppliers of the apps those platforms will run.

## Reconciliation

A new commercial party in open source, operating at the same level as the permissive and copyleft parties we've known so far, would be something largely new in open source history.  If we wanted to bet on record, instead, we'd take reconciliation within the copyleft coalition.

In other words, a new, even stronger copyleft license that both software freedom activists and competitive upstarts could rally behind, in mutual support.  Probably another FSF patch to AGPL, like SSPL, but a patch that the activist community could conceivably make its own.  As Affero GPL became GNU Affero GPL, a new, strong copyleft "fork" that's adaptable for free software purposes.

There is cause for doubt, in the details.

I don't think the FSF is of any mind to write a stronger copyleft license.  More and more, the FSF has constrained itself to soft power, emphasized reconciliation over enforcement, declined to make punitive examples, and accepted praise, attention, and stewardship of key but aging projects, instead of doubling down and drawing lines.  Doctrinally, they've stuck to dogma on license implementation, notably freedom zero absolutism and private changes, that bind their drafters' hands to solve problems more robustly.  In a word, the FSF and its community have become more conciliatory, more esoteric, more insular with age.  It's a young, angry movement where widespread computing, and software freedom, are new.  But only there.

More concretely, the FSF doesn't share upstart business concern about the cracks and crevices in AGPLv3, as it once shared concern about the gaping ASP loophole.  FSF partisans point to activist users of AGPLv3, as it stands now, and see nothing wrong.  In large part because activist projects under AGPL don't offer nearly the bounty value that upstart projects do.  They have succeeded largely within the activist community, and not on the broader scale of open source as a whole.  And in large part because activist AGPLv3 developers don't care about excluding business competitors.  Their use case is different, and they feel it's well addressed.  After all, the license was written for those needs.

That's not to say there's no hunger for a more extreme, streamlined copyleft license among activists.  There's plenty of frustration with the compromises FSF has made.  But here the cross-cutting nature of the new business-oriented licenses comes into play.  I don't perceive any activist demand for the peculiar combination of permissiveness and copyleft, and the specific line drawn between them, that upstart open source database developers crave.  When software freedom activists want a permissive license, they use Apache 2.0.  In vanishing edge cases, they use LGPL.  The FSF position on "service as a software substitute" is that it's pernicious.  Why would activists want a license that allows making free code nonfree for the good kind of software---software you run for yourself---and requires keeping free code free for the bad kind---services substituting for real software?

Overall, I'm sad to say that I think FSF's compromises are catching up with it.  It knows it need allies, but it's keeping the wrong company.  Software freedom activism has trusted that purity of message will create a groundswell of support sufficient to turn the tide of permissive clones, thin clients, and the relegation of free approaches to tooling, back-end components, and building blocks for proprietary end-user applications.  It has optimized for taller pulpits from which to shout its message, but it's lost in the noise.  Unless or until software freedom reality comes to be felt as a crisis, and not just understood as one, I don't think the Free Software Foundation has a stronger license in it to give, or enough flexibility left to accept someone else's license as its standard.

## Radicalization

Where does all this leave everybody who _isn't_ at a big company, and doesn't want to be?  What about the independent developers, small teams, and bootstrapper businesses also struggling to sustain?

My own experiments in strong copyleft licensing, embodied in [Parity](https://licensezero.com/licenses/parity), have tried to point the way for a new, radical copyleft license.  And to do so in a way more responsive to the needs, tastes, and valid points of the BSD School.

Simplicity is key.  Simplicity, eschewing compromise, becomes radical.

Using such a license to protect an upstart commercial venture.

## Forward

Eliot Horowitz, who proposed the Server Side Public License for Open Source Initiative review on behalf of MongoDB, wrote this in an early message in the process:

> If it is not what all communities want, then is it enough that some do?  We expect that others will adopt our license if it is approved and we want them to have the chance to do that.

That is the question, for the OSI process itself, and far more importantly, for the community as a whole.
