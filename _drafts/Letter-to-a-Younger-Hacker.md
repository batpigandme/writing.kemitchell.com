Facebook's in trouble, but you knew Facebook was trouble.  You closed your account, to the extent they let you, years ago.

Your credit card and tax numbers are all for sale.  Target.  Equifax.  Dozens more.  You couldn't opt out of all those systems if you tried.  It was a matter of time.  You knew it was a matter of time.

You're still on Twitter.  You're halfway to quitting, too.  Only half way.  Because you have it easy there.  You see friends who have it harder.  Harassment gangs, gamifications, the posturing, public anxiety of it all.  You and your friends, you're helping each other cope.

Software freedom brought you up.  Set the foundation of everything you've built since.  But you don't think much on software freedom these days.  In some dusty, even nostalgic place, you still believe.  But it's a silent place.  Software freedom is only something you believe, something with which you identify, something, perhaps, through which you relate.  But not something you act out.  Not anymore.

You learned not to.  Software freedom's a hassle.  Like any kind of politics, like Fox News at the Thanksgiving table.  The licenses are long, wordy, broken, behind the times.  A big, preachy interruption to all the work that ought to get done.  So many opinions.

Woe is us, we're stuck in networks that abuse us.

Woe is us, our ethics aren't convenient.

Do you think the two unrelated?

Do you think code you can't see, code you wouldn't be allowed to change, even if you could see it, doesn't lead to networks that entice, hound, addict, abuse, hound, and neglect, whether their coders want it or not?  Do you think one-way, we-make-you-use relationships will turn out fair and accountable?  Do you think an industry of hackers, raised up in software freedom, can go to work on closed, proprietary software, through closed, proprietary process, and somehow shine the ethics of software freedom through?  How?

Networks have gravity.  Social networks.  Payment networks.  Culture networks.  It's hard to escape their pull.  It's so easy to give in, so costly to resist.  The pull of Facebook.  The pull of the credit card.  The pull of the big-box retailer.  The pull of the online marketplace.

The Free Software Movement, for what it's worth, is a network, and also has pull.  It's so much easier to port GCC than to write a compiler.  It's so much easier to tweak WordPress than to build your own CMS.  It's so much easier to download that library than to build it yourself.

Network power is pervasive power.  The free software network affects not just the software sympathetic hackers build, but the software sympathetic hackers don't build, and can't effectively opt out of.  Free software networks implement a policy, a position on software, on how it should be made and used.  They don't enforce that policy, emphasis _force_, but encourage and subsidize it.  Life is better in the network.  Come on in.

Software freedom's influence has been increasingly sequestered.  From the proprietary perspective, a successful campaign of containment.  Some say that "open source" and "free software" are the same.  But open source has won, and software freedom hasn't.
