Name another field with its own "philosophy", "ethics", and definition of "freedom".

I remember my first day of ethics class in law school.  The professor kicked off by pointing out the course was "professional responsibility", not "legal ethics".  The material became mandatory after Watergate.  Throughout the course, we wouldn't be asking "how is this rule morally right?", but rather "who benefits from this rule, and what conflict made a rule necessary?".  We learned about attorney advertising restrictions that violated freedom of speech.  We learned about fee schedules that violated the antitrust laws.  We learned that state legislatures hate personal injury lawyers.

Not that ethics doesn't apply to law.  It can.  It does.  It must.  But there's no such thing as legal ethics, only actual ethics applied to law.  A great deal can be learned about that application from past experience.  Patterns recur.  But all of that's second-order, not a substitute for first principles.  The first principles are hardly a matter of perfect consensus.

When software people promulgate "software philosophy", "software ethics", and home-grown definitions of weighty moral terms like "freedom", we face several possibilities.

They could be applying some more general philosophy, ethics, politics, or ideology to the specific case of software.  If so, which one?  Where did it come from?  Is it any good?  Are there any known problems with it?

They could also be offering something novel, or perhaps independently reinvented.  That prompts some of the same questions:  Where did it come from?  Is it any good?  How does it compare?  But also a few new ones:  What makes software a viable breeding ground for new philosophy, ethics, or politics?  Is software so distinct a philosophical, moral, or political domain that it needs special-case treatment?

As a teenager, I would have answered that free software philosophy was a stunning insight of moral and intellectual genius, fundamentally novel, and vital for our computerized future.  It compares favorably to more generalist-sounding, hand-wavy, university-professor philosophy, and addresses the very special, unique, and model-busting attributes of software.  It tapped the vein of our deepest moral and political wisdom, including the very basis of freedom itself, and channeled it into actionable precepts for a new century.

I hadn't much experience.  I hadn't read much philosophy.  I hadn't lived much of life.  I'm convinced I was nearly entirely wrong.  And I'm convinced I'm not the only true believer looking back on an earlier me with a shaking head.
