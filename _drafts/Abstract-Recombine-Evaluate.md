You have a problem.  Try:

1. Review the insufficient approaches in widespread use.

2. Compare those approaches, identifying commonalities, differences, and variations in different aspects.

3. Extend variations in those aspects along dimensions implied by the comparison.

4. Identify combinations of variations in those aspects not already in widespread use.

5. Evaluate each new combination's effect on your problem.

Survey, abstract, extend, recombine, and evaluate---inductive reasoning in action.

Beware the temptation to stop at step two.  That temptation is very, very strong.  Up to that point, the process is merely descriptive.  Great for writing best-selling business books.  Bad for solving long-running, seemingly intractable problems.

Description, especially description that jives with other, broad descriptions, gives a feeling of control and certainty, a salve on frustration and anxiety in the face of helplessness and uncertainty.  That kind of emotional antidote makes you feel better without making you any better off.  It does nothing to address the circumstances producing your discomfort.

There are infinite ways to abstract approaches in use.  Recombination and evaluation afford a way to judge the merit of those abstractions.  If an abstraction yields no new combinations, or none that seem viable, the abstraction may be pleasing, but it isn't useful.  If you need more than emotional reprieve, discard it.  Come up with another one.

Coming up with another one is often very difficult.  The ability to do so is a form of creativity.
