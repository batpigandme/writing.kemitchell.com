I spent many childhood Sundays in churches around Houston, Texas.  For what reason I know not, I almost always attended "grown-up", rather than children or youth services.  I heard a lot of preaching that way, some inspired, some workmanlike, some outright bad.  The less compelling the speaker, the less deftly they wielded the prickle of sin.

On a novice tongue, sin was a blind rebuke, a kind of pry to pop the week's packaged portion of guilt.  Guilt, in turn, was leverage for injunction.  Like a fortune teller's cold reading, the preachers preached grave sin, and the audience volunteered the personal details.  Having induced a feeling of profound inner inadequacy, call to do or feel such-and-such, by absolution, promised a return to the Heavenly fold.

The trouble with universal sin is universality.  It is, in the broadest possible sense, the norm.  And by implication from a greater creative power, also a matter of design.  Expecting otherwise is unrealistic.  Also purportedly divine.

I have at times been a truly terrible person.  This I can say on the basis of incontrovertible facts.  Damage and hurt done especially to those I love and loved, or who love or loved me.  There are doubtless many more facts to be cited, compounded in guilt by my failure or inability to recognize them as such.  I have been wrong both intentionally, and unwittingly.

My sole moral qualifications, such as they are, consist in my inability to forget many compelling faults, and despite the discomfort inherent, the fact that somehow, I've never questioned the code that rebukes them so, or my identity with respect to it.  I don't doubt that what I did was wrong, or the veracity of the code that calls them so.  I don't doubt that some transgression on my part was inevitable, human, though of course specific faults were mine to make or avoid.  I haven't made myself the bad guy, on the other side of the code, despite grim resignation that try as I may, I will probably fuck up again.
