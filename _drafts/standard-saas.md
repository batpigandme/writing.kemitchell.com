I've begun thinking seriously about a standard contract packet for software-as-a-service sales.

## Overview

SaaS vendors would offer their services on:

1. standard [base terms](#base-terms)
2. [add-ons](#add-ons) supplementing the base terms
3. a [rider](#rider) with terms specific to the vendor
4. an [order form](#order-form) tying them all together

Counsel for potential customers considering the offering would be able to recognize the standard add-ons at a glance, and focus their review on the rider.  

Businesspeople for potential customers would focus on the order form.

## Order Form

- signature blocks
- pricing
- payment terms
- billing terms
- contract term and renewal
- (optional) use limits, like seat count
- incorporates the base terms by reference
- incorporates any add-ons by reference
- incorporates the rider by reference

If the vendor offers terms with add-ons, their order form would fill in the details for those riders:

- (optional) uptime specifics
  - SLA
  - (optional) credit schedule
- (optional) support specifics
  - SLA
  - (optional) credit schedule
  - business hours
  - channels

## Base Terms

- patent compromise

## Rider

- terms specific to the service provider
- overrides base terms and add-ons

## Add-Ons

...

### Uptime

The uptime add-on provide template terms for a service uptime service-level agreement.

- wall-clock-percentage uptime commitment
- credit schedule
- repeat-failure termination

### Support

The support add-on would provide template terms for support services and service-level agreements.

- response time service-level agreement
- triage process
- escalation
- repeat-failure termination

### Insurance

The insurance add-on would require the vendor to maintain a slate of insurance policies.

- itemized policies
- rating requirement
- beneficiary
- waiver of subrogation
- certificates of coverage

### Patent

The patent add-on would supplement the compromise no-known-infringement warranty and indemnity of the base terms with a warranty and an indemnity covering infringement of patents the vendor didn't know about, subject to typical exclusions for infringing combinations with other technology.

### Arbitration

The arbitration add-on would add template terms for a commitment to resolve contract-related disputes by arbitration, rather than public litigation.

Details from the Order Form:

- arbitration group
  - Examples: AAA, JAMS
- rules
- arbitrator selection process
- venue
  - Default: venue for litigation per the base terms

### Data Processing

- GPDR compliance
- Privacy Shield
