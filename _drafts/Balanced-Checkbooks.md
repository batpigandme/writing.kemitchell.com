People used to balance checkbooks.  They'd total up all the payments they received and all the checks they wrote, and make sure the total matched what their bank said at the end of the month.  If the number didn't match, bank and account holder had to work it out.

Bitcoin works a lot like a bank account balanced by those involved.  Each computer that participates in the Bitcoin network reviews the history of transactions, and checks to make sure it comes to the same result about who owns how much Bitcoin.

"Smart Contracts" aren't really contracts.  They're just just programs that computers participating in a network run together.

A smart contract is a bit like a certificate of deposit or a mortgage. It's not a simple transfer from one account to another.  Rather, it's a schedule of credits or debits, as well as other important terms that affect who owes what.
