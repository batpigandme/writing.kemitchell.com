title: LexisNexis Terms for California Case Law
layout: post
---

LexisNexis [provides a free database of California court opinions](http://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/CACourts/) under contract with the state.  But they make you agree to onerous, confusing terms of service to access it.

Line by line:

> *Your use of this Web Site constitutes your agreement to be bound by these terms and conditions of use.*

A rather dubious, dated theory of contract formation.  But they make these terms pop up in a box when you first visit the site, and require you to click a button indicating acceptance, which is stronger.

> The content on this site is provided by LexisNexis速 pursuant to a contract with the State of California for publishing the Official Reports. That contract requires LexisNexis速 to provide a public access Web site with opinion text accurately conforming to officially published versions (see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1105).

Reference to the state contract that requires Lexis to make the service available.

Yes, they are going to put the restricted trademark symbol after "LexisNexis" every time.

> This web site, including all of its features and content (this "Web Site") is a service made available by LexisNexis速, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc., or its affiliates ("Provider") and all content, information, services and software ordered or provided on or through this Web Site ("Content") may be used solely under the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Use").

Note that "Content" includes all the published opinions of California courts, as defined.

> 1\. Web Site Limited License. As a user of this Web Site you are granted a nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable, limited license to access and use this Web Site and Content in accordance with these Terms of Use. Provider may terminate this license at any time for any reason.

I wonder how Lexis' ability to terminate any license at will works with the contractual requirement to provide service.

> 2\. Limitations on Use
>
> 2.1. Limitations on Use.
>
> The Content on this Web Site is for your personal use only and not for commercial exploitation.

Does "commercial exploitation" preclude use in a private law practice?

> Notwithstanding the foregoing and to the extent this Web Site provides electronic commerce, such buying opportunities may be made available for group as well as personal purchasing, so long as you are authorized to make purchases on behalf of such group.

What?

> You may not use the Content to determine a consumer's eligibility for: (a) credit or insurance for personal, family, or household purposes; (b) employment; or (c) a government license or benefit.

> You may not decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, rent, lease, loan, sell, sublicense, or create derivative works from this Web Site or the Content.

> Nor may you use any network monitoring or discovery software to determine the site architecture, or extract information about usage, individual identities or users.

> You may not use any robot, spider, other automatic software or device, or manual process to monitor or copy our Web Site or the Content without Provider's prior written permission.

> You may not use this Web Site to transmit any false, misleading, fraudulent or illegal communications.

> You may not copy, modify, reproduce, republish, distribute, display, or transmit for commercial, non-profit or public purposes all or any portion of this Web Site, except to the extent permitted above.

> You may not use or otherwise export or re-export this Web Site or any portion thereof, or the Content in violation of the export control laws and regulations of the United States of America.

Generic export-law-compliance term.

> Any unauthorized use of this Web Site or its Content is prohibited.

> 3. Not Legal Advice.

> Content is not intended to and does not constitute legal advice and no attorney-client relationship is formed, nor is anything submitted to this Web Site treated as confidential.

> The accuracy, completeness, adequacy or currency of the Content is not warranted or guaranteed.

> Your use of Content on this Web Site or materials linked from this Web Site is at your own risk.

This doesn't seem to align with the contractual requirement to provide "opinion text accurately conforming to officially published versions".  I wonder if an individual could enforce that obligation under the state contract as a third-party beneficiary.

> 4\. Intellectual Property Rights.
>
> 4.1 Except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use, nothing contained herein shall be construed as conferring on you or any third party any license or right, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, under any law (whether common law or statutory law), rule or regulation including, without limitation those related to copyright or other intellectual property rights.

> You agree that the Content and Web Site are protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents or other proprietary rights and laws.

Is this a requirement to agree that works of the government are subject to copyright?

> For further information see Copyright.

> 5\. Digital Millennium Copyright Act - Notification of Alleged Copyright Infringement.

> Provider has registered an agent with the United States Copyright Office in accordance with the terms of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "Act") and avails itself of the protections under the Act.

> Provider will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, subscribers and account holders of Provider's system or network who are repeat infringers of another person's copyright.
