It's widely believed the "legal industry" is particularly hard to sell on new technology.  I once believed that, too.  But no longer.  It's hard to get much of anyone to adopt any new technology, and law-folk cut no particular exception.

As a general rule, in fact, lawyers have been willing to put _more_ time and _more_ money on technology than most, gladly lapping up incremental improvements as they come along.  It is relatively easy to sell a slightly faster printer-scanner-copier, a slightly better smartphone, or a slightly snappier research resource, to a busy lawyer.  Easier still to a law firm of many lawyers, with capital to invest and decision makers aloft in the clouds of firm-wide accounting aggregates and vague business-strategy fluff.

So willingly has the law adopted the slightly better, next, new-old thing, that it has avoided any "crisis", any externally induced reset and rethink to jog its habits.  These are perennial inflection points in other industries' histories, in kinds of service that alternately lag and leap-frog the law in process modernity.  But law-doers get just enough faster, more reliable, and even more affordable, to retain the prerogative to regulate themselves, and hold some cards to play when method comes up with clients.  Truly "game changing" technologies that strike like bolts of lightning out of the blue are few, far between, or just plain nonexistent, when we take into account not only promised benefits, but also the route to getting there, adoption costs.

One must keep one's clients happy.  And their happiness is little dependent on recurring impositions of new and profound process revolutions.  Competing with other lawyers comes mostly down to keeping face by keeping pace on the obvious upgrades, and humming at the same frequency as the current "revolutionary", technocratic buzz.

I stand behind this view as accurate, but incomplete.

For lawyers whose heartstrings run to their clients and stop, it holds.  For lawyers whose eyes wander, covetously, to other lawyers' clients, it also, mostly, holds.  But as soon as we look past the particular legal-needy to whom we answer day-to-day, past the books of colleagues we strive to outshine, it breaks down.  If we allow conscience to recall nobody's clients---those poor souls who should be somebody's clients, but wade the swamps alone---the crisis is real, persistent, and long-festered, beyond living memory.  Someone should have pulled the alarm, run for the exits, counted the dead, and rethought standard lawyering procedure a long time ago.  Tried some things for the sake of trying anything, without preconception, and found what stuck, empirically.  More realistically, some outside force should have made us do it.

This is no great revelation of mine, and in fact there's a term for it: "access to justice".  Perhaps the marketing pull of the coinage carries some weight; I wouldn't deny those who find courage to act from a rallying cry.  But as concerns the particular conscience that rides with me, I hang little hope on set phrases and pithy generalities, even glittering ones.  Better to state it in plain terms, and if at all possible, to think in terms of concrete people.  Conscience thrives on the nitty-gritty, the grody details.

Here's a start:  Most of the people I grew up with, the people who raised me, couldn't afford my hourly rate.

Being the best lawyer that I can be isn't going to change that broad picture, at least if "lawyer" means what I think it means now.  Accepting that frame for a moment, the best lawyer can be isn't anything like legal-messiah caliber.  If I manage to become very, very good, it's doubtful that good will reach very many.  Strategies for broad distribution of any verve, talent, or tenacity I bring to the front boils down to setting some kind of positive example.  Inspiring, but not structurally motivating.  In the worst case, too inspiring to seem practical.

For a time, I held out hope that enough creativity and efficiency---automating broad swathes of my practice, mutual support in networks of good peers, ruthless focus on the client point of view---would enable me to fan out and serve good docs to far more clients.  And that's true.
