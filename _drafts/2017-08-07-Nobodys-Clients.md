It's widely believed the "legal industry" is particularly hard to sell on new technology.  I once believed that, but no longer.  It's hard to get much of anyone to adopt any new technology, and law-folk cut no exception.  But as a general rule, lawyers have been more willing to put more time and more money on technology than most, gladly lapping up each incremental improvement as it comes along.  It is remarkably easy to sell a slightly faster printer-scanner-copier, a slightly better smartphone, or a slightly snappier research resource, to a lawyer.  Easier still to a law firm of many lawyers, with capital to invest and decision makers aloft in the clouds of firm-wide accounting aggregates.

So willingly has the law adopted the slightly better, next, new-old thing, in fact, that it has avoided any "crisis", any externally induced reset and rethink to change its course.  These are perennial features of industries' histories, in kinds of service that alternately lag and leap-frog the law.  But law-doers get just enough faster, more reliable, and even more affordable, to retain the prerogative to regulate themselves.  Truly "game changing" technologies that strike like bolts from the blue are few, far between, or just plain nonexistent, when when we take account not only of the promised benefits, but also the route to getting there, especially adoption costs.

One must keep one's clients happy.  And their happiness is little dependent on recurring impositions of new and profound process revolutions.  Competing with other lawyers comes mostly down to keeping face by keeping pace---and projecting a conspicuous verve for new-gadget buzz---on the obvious upgrades.

This view is accurate, but incomplete.  For lawyers whose heartstrings run to their clients and stop, it holds.  For lawyers whose eyes wander to others' clients, it also, mostly, holds.  But as soon as we look past the particular legally-needy to whom we answer day-to-day, past the jewels of colleagues we strive to outshine for prizes, it breaks down.  If we allow our conscience to recall nobody's clients---those poor souls who should be somebody's clients, but aren't---the crisis is real, present tense, and has festered for all of living memory.

This is no great revelation of mine, and in fact there's a term for it: "access to justice".  Perhaps the marketing pull of the coinage carries some weight; I wouldn't deny those who see the crisis any rallying cry that stirs them.  But as concerns the conscience that rides sidecar with me, which I've come to know a bit in my time, I hold out little hope broad, set phrases and pithy abstractions, even in glistening terms.  Better to state it in plain terms, and if at all possible, to think in terms of concrete people.  Most of the people I grew up couldn't afford my hourly rate.  There's a start.
