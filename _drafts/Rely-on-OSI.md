Relying on the Open Source Initiative to approve and disapprove of licenses, for legal effect, is almost always trouble.  In nearly any practical context, the OSI-approved list will green-light licenses you don't want, and red-light many you do.

There valid and wise ways to rely on OSI. Especially in policy advocacy, where an old nonprofit can go and say where and what you can't.  But relying on a lay advocacy organization to approve licenses for specific, practical effect is different.  In the jargon, it’s a type error, a round peg that happens to fit, badly, in a square hole.

I help clients draft contracts, policies, and other terms all the time.  More often than not, those terms deal with open source software.  What licenses will the developer apply to their work under contract?  What licenses can they accept for the work of others they will use on the job?  What kinds of projects will a service host, or host for free?  How will a nonprofit share work they will do under a grant?  If programmers want to use software they find online under free-of-charge licenses, which are okay, which aren't, and which require special review?

Every time I have answered those questions by referencing OSI approval, I have come to regret it.  I've helped clients make others regret it, too.

Unless your purpose is to track OSI political history or bolster OSI esteem, potentially at some expense to yourself, don't define "open source" by OSI approval in rules, and don't incorporate OSI's approved list by reference for consistency or completeness.  OSI applies analytical rigor to licenses.  But also political expedience, though-leader fashion, and prevailing activist strategy at the time.  Political expedience, thought-leader fashion, and prevailing activist strategy do not afford much chance to correct, or even agree on, which approvals were actually mistakes.

I have criticized the Open Source Definition and the way the Open Source Initiative claims to apply it.  I do not criticize here.  Rather, I draw attention to common misalignments of need, purpose, and perception.  These are differences of kind, not shortcomings of quality or transparency.  You can read nearly all licenses that OSI has approved on opensource.org, and verify their approval.  But to choose and advise responsibly, for specific needs, we must look past how those terms and choices are presented, and read them for ourselves.

## Copyleft

By far the most common misunderstanding is that all OSI-approved licenses make software available for building commercial projects, products, and services.  If that is true at all, it is only technically true, not practically true.

Making it practically true has been a longtime goal of some activists working through OSI.  But they have not succeeded in convincing the software industry to meet requirements of many licenses approved.

If you reference OSI approval expecting permissive, business-friendly terms, you may get strong, activist copyleft terms instead.  Software licensing wonks distinguish "permissive" and "copyleft" open source licenses.  You should, too.

Roughly speaking, permissive open source licenses give everyone permission to do nearly anything with software, for free.  That includes building other software that's licensed under typical commercial software license terms, which OSI does not approve.  And it includes building software that isn't licensed, or even shared, outside a company at all.

[The MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) is a common permissive license.

Copyleft open source licenses, by contrast, require sharing and licensing new software built with copyleft-licensed software.  Specifically, you must share all the code in the best way for others to make changes, and license under open source terms.

[The GNU General Public License, Version 3](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0) is a common copyleft license.

Permissive open source licenses say you can do what you like.  Copyleft open source licenses say you can do what you like, but if you build other software, you must share and license that software alike.

Copyleft licenses differ in how much they require you to share, and when you're required to share.  But all copyleft licenses require sharing in at least some situations.  Under many copyleft licenses, it's occasionally hard to tell whether you have to share or not, even with professional help.

I wish copyleft were simpler.  I'm working on that.  I wish more people, and more businesspeople, understood how well copyleft can meet their needs, both giving and receiving.  I'm working on that, too.  But if permissive open source is free candy, copyleft is a free puppy.  If you want a puppy, a puppy is great.  If you don’t want a puppy, receiving one as a surprise isn’t the best.  Puppies need to food, love, and house training. You may not be ready to give.

If you define acceptable licenses as whatever OSI approves, expecting permissive candy, you may receive surprise copyleft puppies.  I have seen companies sponsor "open source" development, delivery under OSI-approved license of developer's choice, only to discover they had to pay the same developer again to use the work without sharing their proprietary code as open source.  Oops.
