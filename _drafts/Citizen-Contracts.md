With rare exception, people can make fully enforceable contracts, and grant legally enforceable licenses, without any layer involvement at all.  They don't have to have lawyers present.  They don't have to use forms written by lawyers.  Even [spoken agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_contract) about [most thins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_frauds) can be enforced in court, though it's often very difficult to prove a deal was made without something written down.

Bedrock rules of American contract law ask not whether lawyers were involved, but whether two sides [exchanged promises for meaningful benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration), or whether one side [relied on the other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estoppel) in an understandable way, and whether both sides [came to some shared understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meeting_of_the_minds) about the terms of their deal.  Once the law recognizes an agreement as enforceable---as a contract---if there's some dispute about whether one side broke their word or not, the court asks first and foremost what the two sides intended when they made their deal.  There _are_ some traps nonlegal drafters can step in, but overall, courts will try to understand contracts as the people who made them did, and hold them to that.

I'm doing quite a bit of work on contact standardization these days.  I've led the [Waypoint NDA](https://waypointnda.com) for a bit over a year now, though it's much bigger than just me now.  I cofounded [Blue Oak Council](https://blueoakcouncil.org) and [PolyForm Project](https://polyformproject.org) last year, both of which publish free legal resources.  I'm gathering steam for [SaaS Passport](https://saaspassport.com), a legal Erector set for software-as-a-service sales.  I've published [terms for open source contractors](https://switchmode.github.io) and website terms of service and terms for California privacy law compliance.  I [run a company](https://licensezero.com) that standardizes (and automates) an IP-licensing-based busines model.  And I'm working a dozen other lawyers to do this kind of work in more domains.

A legal-terms standardization project is fundamentally an admission that many deals of a type can, should, and will be done without lawyer involvement.  In nearly all those deals, a lawyer could deliver some added value, to one side or both.  After all, no off-the-rack form is ever a perfect fit for any particular transaction.  But the benefit of custom tailoring, or even professional supervision, has to be weighed against its cost.  For a lot of kinds of business, a lawyer-drafted form, and no lawyer, represents the best way forward for the parties.

That begs the question: Are there circumstances where no lawyer input at all---no lawyers, no lawyer forms---best serve the parties?  In other words, are there situations when non-lawyers should just scrawl their terms down on a sheet of paper, or put them in an e-mail, and proceed on the very barest statement of who promises what?  Clearly the answer must be yes.  But "yes" doesn't tell us how often this is the case, for any kind of contract.
