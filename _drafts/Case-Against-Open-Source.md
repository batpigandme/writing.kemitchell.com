title: The Case Against Open Source
description: advocatus diaboli

The open source software hype is a lot of software people telling themselves that what's good for them is good for everyone else.  Everyone else does not agree.

In reality, open source does less good than it gives itself credit for.  What good it does do, it does overwhelmingly for itself and its own kind.  But as a rule, coders enthralled with open source look too much in on themselves, and too little past their own satisfaction, to notice.  I have been one of them.

In many, many cases, software could do more and better for people who _aren't_ programmers, and society as a whole, in closed rather than open form.  But that is still biting the hook of the open-closed line, which only distracts from the point.  When it comes to doing good, openness as coders define it is at most an implementation detail, and not a very reliable one, in a project of public service.  An open license or process does not make software an act of noble charity or progress, any more than a license fee or a tight-knit development group make it pillage and plunder.

## Insularity

Open source---and free software for that matter---are not so much cathedral and bazaar as cathedral and [scriptorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptorium), the whole scene comfortably situated in an aloof, quasi-[monastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery), closed-loop community, obsessed with its own piety and getting high on its own supply of home-grown philosophy, theory, and culture.  If coders want to do good in the world, or to receive praise for doing good in the world, they ought to measure their impact outside of software, not within it.

Like the great monasteries of yore, open source has enjoyed a fat season of cachet and accumulating wealth.  The patronage and subsidy of industry, which increases its power by exclusive access to monastic services, provides the money.  Business school book writers, and the politicians who read them, follow on with the plaudits.  And as usual, the hoi polloi has made an equal and opposite reaction, toward resentment, which is easily ignored.  The stage is set for a [mendicant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendicant_orders) countermovement, rejecting isolation and the acquisitive urge to be among the people.  A new ethic that prioritizes developer-user collaboration over and above developer-developer collaboration, and software used by more than just other software people.

Non-techie, non-pols, as a rule, don't see software people as a noble, enlightened order of liberating altruists, open or proprietary, any more than they do lawyers or bankers or government bureaucrats.  They see techies coming into their own as a distinct, competitive, increasingly self-aware interest group, like insurance or banking or trade unionism, conspiring against the laity for its scratch, like all the rest.  When I remember to be quiet and listen, people who don't make software for fun or profit make plenty clear that nothing open source offers really interests them, apart from its price.  Even at zero price, there are usually better options these days.

Fundamentally, people don't want to be programmers.  A few do, and some more will.  But those are tiny minorities of the whole.  Most would rather put the time and attention required into similarly deep, engrossing specialities fascinating to them.  In the same way that most programmers won't be great cooks or physicians or dancers anytime soon.

When it comes to consuming the programming of others, people don't want to download, install, or upgrade anything.  App stores smooth it over a bit.  Self-updating apps do a bit more.  Evergreen services are by far the best.  Especially with slick, well integrated interfaces preinstalled on devices.  The drive to possess or collect software, noted among enthusiasts, isn't felt by most users.  As a rule, people don't keep shelves of old e-mail clients or Microsoft Word versions, as wonks do classic video games or vinyl records.

Even with all manner of options available, people don't want to mix and match, cobble solutions together, or fettle them to perfection, either.  They don't want to get their hands dirty integrating or customizing software any more than they want to tune up their own cars, do their own taxes, or take their own dental x-rays.  They want someone else to do those things for them, to take responsibility for getting it right and helping them feel good about it.

As a consequence, users generally don't care about source code, or even care to know what it is.  You can lecture them on the benefits of being able to hire some _other_ techie to maintain or change it for them, as needed.  But they'll glaze over, and not because they just don't get it.  It's the techies who don't get it.  Switching horses midstream is a very distant second best.  Users are going to have to depend on _somebody_ for the phone or tablet or computer to do what they want.  They would rather have a good, sturdy, long-term relationship for that than treat or be treated like a fungible mark in a dog-eat-dog market.

Insofar as choosing a free or open license or a free or open model either complicates or eviscerates your ability to devote full time to the kinds of relationships non-coder users really want, to hold up your end of a huge delegation of responsibility and opportunity, choosing those options willfully decreases the good your work will do others.  With one caveat.  Choose the right license, and your work may very well bestow a significant engineering subsidy on firms that interpose themselves between you, your software, and end users.  But only at the cost of further disconnection between open source and service to the public and a redirection of the fruits of the labor from source to middleman.

## Vanity

Ideas about ethics and value and goodness from free and source don't survive because they well reflect reality.  They survive, among programmers, because programmers like the sound of them.

We like them, in part, because they are simple.  Too simple.

We like them, in part, because we are the heroes, or easily could be, in all the stories.

We like them, in part, because they lend an halo of altruism and nobility to what we wanted to do anyway.
