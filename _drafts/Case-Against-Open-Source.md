title: The Case Against Open Source

Software people love telling each other that what's good for them is good for the world.  And they get away with it, so long as the world isn't around to disagree.  About being "eaten" by software.  About "disrupting" literally everything.  About coders as new "kingmakers".  About salvation---from the abuses of software people---through the catechism of "open source".

It's getting harder to pretend the world agrees.  There are too many headlines.  Too many leaks.  Too many hearings.  The world isn't awed anymore.  It's angry, shocked, and resigned, unable to quit and therefore resentful.

Like the free food in a Silicon Valley headquarters cafeteria, open source does good, but overwhelmingly for its own kind: software developers and technology companies.  But that's as far as developers looking to advance their own projects and careers tend to see.  The open source "revolution" feels and sounds good.  It plays well in like-minded company.  It bedazzles parents, friends, and suggestible passersby.  Without accountability, a good story and the deference of our peers are more than enough.

Outside the bubble, it's clear that software people could do a lot more good, for a lot more people, than churning out more code for each other under MIT, BSD, and Apache 2.0.  By taking projects outside their own narrow self-interest, specifically for people who aren't programmers.  By doing business and collaborating in ways that welcome and support relationships with the outside world.  By adopting an attitude and a discipline of service, rather than self-service and self-congratulation.

In most cases, this would look a lot less "open".  But that's biting the hook again.  To the practical outside eye, open, closed, and all the esoteric nuances between them are just means, and unreliable ones at that, passing as ends.  Open licenses, even open processes, don't make software into an act of public service or civic progress, any more than a license fee or a tight-knit development group make it pillage and plunder.  Pretending otherwise is a cheat code, a shortcut, a ideological philosopher's stone that transforms conspiracy against the laity and fun-but-frivolous hobby work into an ethical coup and a grand service to society.  It is not far removed from the cook in the garage building perpetual motion to save the world, who occasionally emits a better mousetrap or gadget despite in passing.

Robust ethics of public service existed long before software programming, and will continue to exist long after the last pay stub for anyone called "programmer" has been paid.  The bad of their honor is accountability, which the dominant software culture not only avoids, but rejects, attacks, or simply ignores.

## Insularity

The first charge in the case against open source is insularity.  Open source is stuck in itself.

Non-techie, non-pols, as a rule, don't see software people as a noble, enlightened order of liberating altruists, any more than they do lawyers or bankers or bureaucrats.  They see techies coming into their own as a distinct, competitive, increasingly self-conscious interest group, like insurance or banking or media.  They see it conspiring against the laity for its scratch, like all the rest.

Open source---and free software for that matter---are not so much cathedral and bazaar as cathedral and [scriptorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptorium), the whole scene within the walls of an aloof, quasi-[monastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery), closed-loop community.  That community nurses its own, hermetically sealed definition of piety, getting high on its own supply of home-grown philosophy, theory, and culture. The vast majority of that philosophy, theory, and culture boils down to cartoonish applications of opportunistically selected, defunct schools of thought from the actually relevant fields.  If coders want to do good in the world, or to receive praise for doing good in the world, they ought to measure their impact outside of software, by universal standards, not within it, under standards they pick and choose from history.

Like the great monasteries of yore, open source has enjoyed a fat season of patronage and praise.  The regard and subsidy of industry, which caught on to "open source" and learned to leverage access to monastic services, provides the money, the marketing, and the promise of more.  Business book pundits, and the politicians who read them, follow on with the plaudits.  Cash, praise, and a community bound together by them: what else could the common coder want?

Fulfillment.  Relevance.  An ability to respond credibly to opportunities and crises in the society as a whole.  Like economic equality.  Like persistent racism.  Like resurgent authoritarian politics.  Like widespread corruption.

The stage is set for a [mendicant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendicant_orders) countermovement in software development, rejecting isolation, subculture, and the acquisitive urge to be among the people again.  A new ethic that prioritizes developer-user collaboration over and above developer-developer collaboration, and software used to make more than more software.  A user advocacy that looks beyond users who are or want to be programmers first.

## Imperialism

The second charge in the case against open source is imperialism.  As a rule, open source conditions its generosity and attention on submission to its subculture and admission to its tribe.  Its charity stops at its borders.

When I remember to be quiet and listen, people who don't make software make plenty clear that nothing about open source really interests them, apart from its price.  Even at zero dollars, there are often far better options these days.

This is not hard to explain.  Most of the features open source has that the alternatives don't simply do not matter in practice to non-programmers, and most non-programmers don't really want to become programmers.

Rightfully so.  Learning to program is an enormous time and effort commitment, compounded by prior coders' endemic delight in the quirky, historical, esoteric, and redundant.  Pick a popular language or platform.  Whichever you choose, feature creep  likely made it harder to learn in the last five years.  Most people, and most very literate people, would rather put the time and attention into similarly deep, engrossing fields that call out to them, rather than a long climb up a hill that keeps getting steeper.  Similarly, the average programmer is far more likely to learn a new programming language in the next year than any substantial part of medicine, firefighting, cookery, music, art, or dance.

When it comes to consuming the programming of others, people don't want to download, install, or upgrade anything.  App stores smooth it over a bit.  Self-updating binaries are better still.  Evergreen services are by far the best.  Especially with slick, well integrated interfaces preinstalled on devices.

Nor do people want to mix and match components, cobble their own solutions together, or fettle them to personalized perfection.  They don't want to get their hands dirty integrating or customizing software any more than they want to tune up their own cars, do their own taxes, or take their own x-rays.  They want someone else to do those things for them, to take responsibility for getting it right, and to help them feel good about the results. When their consciences fully engage---a big "if" in an age of impersonal, intermediating platforms---they want to those relationships to be fair and fruitful for both sides.

As a consequence, users generally don't care about source code, binaries, patches, and all the rest.  They don't even care to know what those are.  You can lecture them on the benefits of being able to call in some _other_ hireling techie to maintain or change source, if a bus, a bankruptcy, or an acquisition take the programmer they've chosen to trust away.  But they'll glaze over, and not because they just don't get it, or can't see that far.

The techies don't get it.  Switching horses midstream is a very distant second best, whether the horse is a doctor, a coder, a hairdresser, or a tax preparer.  Users are going to have to depend on _somebody_ for the phone or tablet or computer to do what they want in the time and budget they have.  They would rather have a good, sturdy, long-term relationship that doesn't repeatedly trigger their fight-or-flight reflex than treat or be treated like a fungible mark in a dog-eat-dog market.

Insofar as choosing a free or open model complicates or eviscerates your ability to devote full time to the kinds of relationships non-coder users really want, to hold up your end of a huge delegation of responsibility and opportunity, choosing such an option willfully decreases the good your work will do for others.  You are highly unlikely to make the money you need for consistent development, much less the money needed for establishing, renewing, and participating in end-user relationships.  You are hobbling your own ability to provide the kinds of relationships users want.

Insofar as choosing a free or open license kicks the can on end-user relationship building to whatever firm might be willing to step in between, choosing such an optional also limits the good you can do.  A relationship with a middleman, especially a middleman with very strong ulterior motives, is a far cry from a relationship with a coder who cares.  Disconnecting software and service, and diverting fruits from the labor, does not a free and fair society make.

None of this is hard to see or difficult to reason from.  Except with the idea that everyone wants to be or praise a programmer in the way.

## Vanity

The third charge in the case against open source is vanity.  Open source ideology cannot see clearly because it likes the story it tells about itself.

Ideas about ethics and value and goodness from free and source don't survive because they well reflect reality.  They survive, among programmers, because programmers like the sound of them.

We like them, in part, because they are simple.  Too simple.

We like them, in part, because we are the heroes, or easily could be, in all the stories.

We like them, in part, because they lend an halo of altruism and nobility to what we wanted to do anyway.
