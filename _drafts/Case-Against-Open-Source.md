title: The Case Against Open Source
---

> I have studied the art of the ancients and the art of the moderns, avoiding any preconceived system and without prejudice.  I no longer wanted to imitate the one than to copy the other; nor, furthermore, was it my intention to attain the trivial goal of "art for art's sake".  No!  I simply wanted to draw forth, from a complete acquaintance with tradition, the reasoned and independent consciousness of my own individuality.

Open source does less good than it gives itself credit for.  What good it does do, it does overwhelmingly for itself.  But as a rule, programmers enthralled with open source look too much in on themselves, and too little past their own satisfaction, to notice.  I have been one of them.

In many, many cases, software could do more and better for people who _aren't_ programmers and society as a whole in closed rather than open form.  But even that's buying into the open-closed line.  When it comes to doing good, openness is just an implementation detail, and not a very reliable one.  An open license or process does not make software an act of noble charity.  Price or a tight-nit development group does not make it an act of abusive plunder.

The first charge is insularity.  Open source---and free software for that matter---are not so much cathedral and bazaar as cathedral and [scriptorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptorium), the whole scene comfortably situated in one aloof, quasi-[monastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery), closed-loop community, obsessed with its own piety and getting high on its own supply of home-grown philosophy, theory, and culture.

Like the great monasteries of yore, open source has enjoyed a fat season of social cachet and accumulating wealth.  The patronage and subsidy of industry, which increases its power by exclusive access to monastic services, provided the money.  Business school book writers, and the politicians who read them, followed on with the cachet.  And as usual, the hoi polloi has made an equal and opposite reaction, toward resentment.  The stage is set for a [mendicant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendicant_orders) countermovement.

>  At their foundation these orders rejected the previously established monastic model.  This foresaw living in one stable, isolated community where members worked at a trade and owned property in common, including land, buildings and other wealth.  By contrast, the mendicants avoided owning property at all, did not work at a trade, and embraced a poor, often itinerant lifestyle.  They depended for their survival on the goodwill of the people to whom they preached.

Non-techie, non-pols, as a rule, don't see software people as a noble, enlightened order of liberating altruists, open or proprietary.  They see techies coming into their own as a distinct, competitive, increasingly self-aware interest group, like insurance or banking or trade unionism, conspiring against other tribes for their own scratch, like all the rest.  When I remember to be quiet and listen, people who don't make software for fun or profit make plenty clear they really want nothing that open source offers.  Even at zero price, there are usually better options these days.

People don't really want to be programmers.  A few do, and some will.  But those are tiny minorities.  Most would rather put the time and attention on similarly deep, engrossing specialities fascinating to them.  Most programmers aren't great cooks or physicians or dancers.

People don't want to download, install, or upgrade anything.  App stores smooth it over a bit.  Self-updating apps do a bit more.  But evergreen services are by far the best.  Especially with a slick, well integrated interface preinstalled on the device.

People don't want to mix and match, cobble solutions together, or fettle them to perfection.  They don't want to get their hands dirty in software, any more than they want to tune up their cars, do their own taxes, or take dental x-rays.  They want someone else to do it for them, and to take responsibility for getting it right and helping them feel good about it.

As a general rule, other people don't care about source code, or even really know what it is.  You can lecture them on the benefits of being able to hire some _other_ techie to maintain or change it for them, as needed.  But they'll glaze over, and not because they don't get it.  Techies don't get it.  Switching horses midstream is a very distant second best.  They are going to have to depend on _somebody_ for the phone or tablet or computer to do what they want.  They would rather have a good, sturdy, long-term relationship for than than treat or be treated like a fungible cog in a dog-eat-dog market.

Insofar as choosing a free or open license or a free or open model saps your ability to develop the kinds of relationships non-coder users really want, choosing those options willfully decreases the good your work will do others.  With one caveat.  Choose the right license, and your work may very well.

<!-- Stories we like to hear.  Stories that fit the world. -->
The second charge is vanity.  Ideas about ethics and value and goodness from free and source don't survive because they well reflect reality.  They survive, among programmers, because programmers like them.

We like them, in part, because they are simple.  Too simple.

We like them, in part, because we are the heroes, or easily could be, in all the stories.

We like them, in part, because they lend an halo of altruism and nobility to what we wanted to do anyway.
