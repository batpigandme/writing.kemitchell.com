title: The Case Against Open Source
---

> I have studied the art of the ancients and the art of the moderns, avoiding any preconceived system and without prejudice.  I no longer wanted to imitate the one than to copy the other; nor, furthermore, was it my intention to attain the trivial goal of "art for art's sake".  No!  I simply wanted to draw forth, from a complete acquaintance with tradition, the reasoned and independent consciousness of my own individuality.

Open source does less good than it gives itself credit for.  What good it does do, it does overwhelmingly for itself.  But as a rule, programmers high on open source look too much in on themselves, and too little past their own satisfaction, to notice.  In many, many cases, software could do more and better for people who _aren't_ programmers in closed form than in open.  But even that's putting too much emphasis on openness.  It is, as they say, just an implementation detail.

The charge is insularity.  Open source---and free software for that matter---are not so much cathedral and bazaar as cathedral and scriptorium, the whole scene comfortably situated in one aloof, quasi-monastic, closed-loop community, obsessed with its own piety and getting high on its own supply of home-grown philosophy, theory, and culture.

Like the great monasteries of yore, open source has enjoyed a fat season of social cachet and accumulating wealth.  The patronage and subsidy of industry, which increases its power by exclusive access to monastic services, provided the money.  Business school book writers, and the politicians who read them, followed on with the cachet.  And as usual, the hoi polloi has made an equal and opposite reaction, toward resentment.  The stage is set for a mendicant countermovement.

Non-techie, non-pols, as a rule, don't see software people as a great, enlightened mob of liberating altruists, open or proprietary.  They see techies coming into their own as a distinct, competitive, increasingly self-aware interest group, like insurance and accounting and banking and unions, conspiring against their laity for their own scratch like all the rest.  When I remember to be quiet and listen, people who don't make software for fun or profit make plenty clear they really want nothing that open source offers.  But even at zero price, there are usually far better options for them.

Other people, as a rule, don't really want to be programmers.  Some do, and some will.  But those are a tiny minority.  Most would rather put the time and attention on similarly deep, engrossing specialities fascinating to them.

Other people, as a rule, do not want to download, install, or upgrade anything.  App stores smooth it over a bit.  Self-updating apps do a bit better, too.  But services are by far the best.  Especially with a slick, well integrated interface preinstalled on the device.

Other people, as a rule, do not want to cobble solutions together or fettle them to perfection.  They don't want to get their hands dirty with software, any more than they want to tune up their own cars, do their own taxes, or take their own x-rays.  They want someone else to do it for them, and to take responsibility for getting it right and making them feel good about it.

As a general rule, other people don't care about source code.  You can lecture them on the benefits of being able to hire someone _else_ to maintain or change it for them, but they'll glaze over, and not because they don't understand.  Switching horses midstream is a very distant second best for most people.  They are going to have to depend on _somebody_ for the software they want.  They would rather have a good, sturdy, developing relationship than to treat or be treated like a fungible cog in a dog-eat-dog market.
