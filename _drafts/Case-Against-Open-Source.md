title: The Case Against Open Source
description: advocatus diaboli
---

Software people love telling each other that what's good for them is good for the world.  And they get away with it, so long as the world isn't around to disagree.  About being "eaten" by software.  About "disrupting" literally everything.  About coders' role as the new "kingmakers".  About salvation---from the abuses of software people---through "open source".

It's getting harder to pretend the world agrees.  There are too many headlines.  Too many leaks.  Too many hearings.  The world isn't awed anymore.  It's angry, shocked, and resigned, unable to quit and therefore resentful.

Like the free food in a Silicon Valley HQ cafeteria, open source does good, but overwhelmingly for its own kind: software developers and technology companies.  That's as far as developers looking to advance their own projects and careers tend to see.  The open source "revolution" sounds good.  It plays well in like-minded company.  It can bedazzle a few parents, friends, and suggestible passersby.  Without accountability, that story and that deference are more than enough.

Outside the bubble, it's clear that software people could do a lot more good, for a lot more people, than churning out more code for each other under MIT, BSD, and Apache 2.0.  By taking projects outside their own narrow self-interest, specifically for people who aren't programmers.  By doing business and collaborating in ways that welcome and support relationships with the outside world.  By adopting an attitude and a discipline of service, rather than self-service and self-congratulation.

In most cases, this would look a lot less "open".  But that's biting the hook again.  To the practical outside eye, open, closed, and all the esoteric nuances between them are just means, and unreliable ones, dressing up as ends.  Open licenses, even open processes, don't make software into an act of public service or civic progress, any more than a license fee or a tight-knit development group make it pillage and plunder.  Pretending otherwise is a cheat code, a shortcut, a ideological philosopher's stone that transforms conspiracy against the laity and fun-but-frivolous hobby work into an ethical coup and a grand service to society.

Robust ethics of public service existed long before software programming, and will continue to exist long after the last pay stub for anyone called "programmer" has been paid.  Their cornerstones are checks and balances---accountability---that the dominant software culture not only avoids, but rejects and attacks.

## Insularity

The first charge in the case against open source is insularity.  Open source is stuck within itself.

Open source---and free software for that matter---are not so much cathedral and bazaar as cathedral and [scriptorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptorium), the whole scene comfortably situated in an aloof, quasi-[monastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery), closed-loop community.  That community produces its own, hermetically sealed definition of piety, getting high on its own supply of home-grown philosophy, theory, and culture.  If coders want to do good in the world, or to receive praise for doing good in the world, they ought to measure their impact outside of software, by universal standards, not within it, as they choose for themselves.

Like the great monasteries of yore, open source has enjoyed a fat season of cachet and some accumulated wealth.  The patronage and subsidy of industry, which caught on to "open source" and increases its power by exclusive access to monastic services, provides the money and the promise of money.  Business book pundits, and the politicians who read them, follow on with the plaudits.  Cash and praise, and a community brought together by them: what else could the common coding animal want?

Fulfillment.

The stage is set for a [mendicant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendicant_orders) countermovement in software development, rejecting isolation, subculture, and the acquisitive urge to be among the people again.  A new ethic that prioritizes developer-user collaboration over and above developer-developer collaboration, and software used to make more than more software.  A user advocacy that looks beyond users who are or want to be programmers.

## Imperium

The second charge in the case against open source is imperium.  Open source conditions benefits on admission to its own tribe.

There is room to improve the relationship.  Non-techie, non-pols, as a rule, don't see software people as a noble, enlightened order of liberating altruists, any more than they do lawyers or bankers or government bureaucrats.  They see techies coming into their own as a distinct, competitive, increasingly self-conscious interest group, like insurance or banking or law, conspiring against the laity for its scratch, like all the rest.  When I remember to be quiet and listen, people who don't make software for fun and profit make plenty clear that nothing about open source offers really interests them, apart from its price.  Even at zero dollars, there are often far better options these days.

Fundamentally, most people don't want to be programmers, and they are no lesser for it.  A few do, and some of those will.  But they are tiny minorities of the whole, and rightfully so.

Learning to program is an enormous time and effort commitment, compounded by prior programmers' endemic delight in the quirky, historical, esoteric, and redundant.  Pick a programming language or platform.  There are many.  Whichever you choose, feature creep is likely to have made it harder to learn in the last five years, and still at work.  Most people, and most very literate people, would rather put that time and attention into similarly deep, engrossing fields inherently fascinating to them.  In the same way that programmers stand far more likely to learn a new programming language in the next year than any substantial part of medicine, firefighting, cookery, or the like.

Moreover, when it comes to consuming the programming of others, people don't want to download, install, or upgrade anything.  App stores smooth it over a bit.  Self-updating binaries are better still.  Evergreen services are by far the best.  Especially with slick, well integrated interfaces preinstalled on devices.

The drive to possess or collect software, noted among enthusiasts, isn't felt by the vast majority of users in the least.  As a rule, people don't stock shelves with box copies of old e-mail clients, word processors, or social networks, as many do books, video games, vinyl records, or works of graphic art.  Code is very rarely that kind of medium.

Even with all manner of options available, nor do people want to mix and match, cobble solutions together, or fettle them to personal perfection.  They don't want to get their hands dirty integrating or customizing software any more than they want to tune up their own cars, do their own taxes, or take their own dental x-rays.  They want someone else to do those things for them, to take responsibility for getting it right and to help them feel good about the relationship. When their consciences fully engage---a big if in an age of impersonal, intermediating platforms---they want to those relationships to be fair and fruitful, for both sides.

As a consequence, users generally don't care about source code, or even care to know what it is.  You can lecture them on the benefits of being able to call in some _other_ hireling techie to maintain or change it, if a bus or negotiating mishap takes the first away.  But they'll glaze over, and not because they just don't get it.

The techies don't get it.  Switching horses midstream is a very distant second best, whether the horse is a doctor, a coder, a hairdresser, or a maid.  Users are going to have to depend on _somebody_ for the phone or tablet or computer to do what they want for the time and money they have.  They would rather have a good, sturdy, long-term relationship that doesn't repeatedly trigger their fight-or-flight reflex than treat or be treated like a fungible mark in a dog-eat-dog market.

Insofar as choosing a free or open model complicates or eviscerates your ability to devote full time to the kinds of relationships non-coder users really want, to hold up your end of a huge delegation of responsibility and opportunity, choosing such an option willfully decreases the good your work will do for others.  You are highly unlikely to make the money you need for consistent development, much less the money needed for establishing, renewing, and participating in end-user relationships.

Insofar as choosing a free or open license kicks the can on end-user relationship building to whatever firm might be willing to step in between, choosing such an optional also limits the good you can do.  A relationship with a middleman, especially a middleman with very strong ulterior motives, is a far cry from a relationship with a coder who cares.  Disconnecting software and service, and diverting fruits from the labor, does not a free and fair society make.

## Vanity

The first charge in the case against open source is vanity.

Ideas about ethics and value and goodness from free and source don't survive because they well reflect reality.  They survive, among programmers, because programmers like the sound of them.

We like them, in part, because they are simple.  Too simple.

We like them, in part, because we are the heroes, or easily could be, in all the stories.

We like them, in part, because they lend an halo of altruism and nobility to what we wanted to do anyway.
