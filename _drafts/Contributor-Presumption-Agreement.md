<!--
Expand documentation describing --signoff

Modify various document (man page) files to explain in more detail what --signoff means.

This was inspired by https://lwn.net/Articles/669976/ where paulj noted, "adding [the] '-s' argument to [a] git commit doesn't really mean you have even heard of the DCO...". Extending git's documentation will make it easier to argue that developers understood --signoff when they use it.
