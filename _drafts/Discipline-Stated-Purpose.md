Whenever you draft contract language, write and include a general statement of purpose along with your specific terms.

First and foremost, writing clarifies thought.  The artful drafter delivering flawless terms that miss client purpose fails the client.  Understanding client purpose takes priority over understanding the specifics of technical language.  Applying your best clarifying tool to terms, but not client purpose, makes no sense.

Secondarily, accept that the most artful drafter writes imperfect terms.  Most contract terms never get reread.  Most contract terms clients do read suffice to diffuse conflict.  But there are always conflict risks written language does not anticipate.

Purpose statements within the four corners give courts something to fall back on.  Without purpose statements, they have to work backwards from terms to purpose, or even worse, apply totally generic rules of construction.  Courts assess purpose in many circumstances, not just severability and material breach.

Purpose statements give clients something to lean on.  Some clients will read and understand every term you prepare for them.  It's nice to be appreciated, but that's a redundant waste of time.  Time spent coming to feel and see their purposes expressed by their lawyer in their terms, on the other hand, creates confidence in lawyer and terms.  Confidence makes redundant waste of time unnecessary.

Purpose statements help lawyers.  Write a purpose statement, then write terms achieving that purpose.  Compare them.  When the purpose statement achieves everything the terms do, in plainer language, replace the terms with the purpose statement.  Your draft gains clarity, and loses nothing.

This exercise has helped my drafting many times.  For example, in writing public licenses for software, I've been asked to write terms that assure licensees that they won't be sued under copyright or patent law for making use of the licensed software.  Traditionally, intellectual property lawyers fulfill that purpose by writing copyright license grants that list out all the exclusive rights of copyright holders, and patent licenses that list all the means of infringing a patent.

I'd written an overall license purpose like so:

> Give licensees permission to do everything with the software.

And a copyright license purpose like so:

> Give licensees permission to do everything that would otherwise count as copyright infringement.

And a license grant like this:

> Licensor grants you a license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, ... the software.

What was gained from listing out the exclusive rights of copyright holders?  Nothing.  What would be gained by referencing 35 USC 106, or the Copyright Act as a whole?  Nothing.

Clients don't know what the exclusive rights of copyright holders are.  They don't know they appear in the Copyright Act or Title 35 of the United States Code.  They wouldn't know if my list of rights matches the list in the Act.  None of that is relevant.

I replaced the license grant with something like:

> Licensor grants you a license to do everything with the software that would otherwise infringe copyright in the software.
