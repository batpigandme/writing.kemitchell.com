I like Matt Asay, but his open source is very different from mine.  In a [recent post][post], Matt offers a flat rebuke to several developers yanking code or changing license terms in protest of organizations doing things they abhor, like the United States' Immigrations and Customers Enforcement (ICE).

When Matt writes:

> You cannot block objectionable uses of your software and still have it remain open source.

He is wrong for any meaning of "open source" but his own.

What we now call open source _began_ with licenses that blocked objectionable uses of software: uses in closed, proprietary projects.  Ethics drove that objection.  [Quoth RMS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.html):

> I make my code available for use in free software, and not for use in proprietary software, in order to encourage other people who write software to make it free as well.  I figure that since proprietary software developers use copyright to stop us from sharing, we cooperators can use copyright to give other cooperators an advantage of their own: they can use our code.

When Matt writes:

> Open use is the price we pay for open source

He is wrong.  Again: unless you happen to share his absolute-libertarian view of open source _meaning_ totally unrestricted use.

Nothing about a license expressing your ethics stops you sharing code online, accepting contributions from others, distributing with very low friction to end users, leveraging the work of others, or having your work leveraged by them in turn.  The gatekeepers who insist on one kind of absolutism or another, from the Open Source Initiative to the Free Software Foundation to Debian package mirrors, matter less every day.

It wasn't true that good, collaborative software had to come from a place of shared software freedom activism, as the FSF faithful once preached.  It isn't any more true that good, collaborative software has to come from a place of techno-libertarian absolutism, as techno-libertarian absolutists now claim.  As all stripes of free-open activists have learned, there is _no_ obligation to accept the practical benefits of their techniques in a package with their ethics, their philosophy, or their politics.

To give Matt credit, he's totally open---catch the pun?---about the tautology underlying his rebukes.  _Why_ does openness require an utter lack of ethical restrictions?

> Why?  Because...open source.

When Matt writes:

> Now imagine if every developer channeled their inner Vargo and started pulling their code because they don't like this or that organizationâ€”it would completely dismantle the open source world that so many of us depend upon.

Or:

> We can't control outcomes and keep our code open source.  We can only contribute the best code we can and hope that, on balance, much more good comes of it than bad. It's the price of openness, and it's worth paying. 

He is partly right.  If "open source" _means_ the strict equality of "open" and "free of ethical restriction", then more and more developers choosing licenses and taking actions that don't align threatens the ability of no-ethical-restriction absolutists to claim most folks hacking code online belong to their camp.  The very same kind of shift forced humility on those for whom "free software" _meant_ the strict equality of "free" and "protecting users".

In the past, stoking fear of law, then monopolizing access to legal talent, allowed specific camps---RMS-style counterculture creatures and ESR-style techno-libertarians---to limit developer choice to licenses they could take credit for, and count toward party rolls in the brewing popularity contest.  Intentional or not, that manipulation politically expedient, but also ethically wrong.  As an attorney in private practice, it disgusts me.

Mantras like "Don't write your own license!", extending "license proliferation" to prohibit _any_ new licenses, even new ones that said new things, and the "crayon license" mark of shame all kept hackers from taking legal power into their own hands.  This is what I mean when I say [the hood of the license machine is welded shut](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/08/31/Null-Value.html), and what I work to cure by popularizing the [Flipped Form](https://flippedform.com) concept, by encouraging hackers to write and propose license patches, and by [publishing step-by-step guides to writing new licenses for communities of ethical concern](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/03/15/Ethical-Subcommons.html).  This is what I support when I personally wade in to draft licenses for new schools of thought, like [Parity](https://paritylicense.com) and [Prosperity](https://prosperitylicense.com).

If you lack a good project structure that enables you to contribute online without moral qualms, you should make one.  Incumbent political ideologies shouldn't pressure you into subjugating your moral conscience to theirs.  If you lack a good license option to express your conscience and your conditions through the one channel users actually check with any reliability, you should have one.  Incumbent institutions shouldn't pressure you into letting them speak for you in license terms, instead of supporting you in speaking for yourself.
