I've only just got around to Nadia Eghbal's ["The rise of few-maintainer projects"](https://increment.com/open-source/the-rise-of-few-maintainer-projects/), for Stripe's [_Increment_](https://increment.com/) journal.  If you read this blog for open source, you should read Nadia's post, not to mention most of the rest of what she's written in the past few years.

Nadia's point, as I read it, is to recognize that most projects are small projects, bound together more by convention than direct collaboration, and adjust expectations accordingly.  And it's a point I like, because I'm a small-modules kind of guy.  The contrary mentality, which focuses more on large projects, [is just as valid](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/05/18/Schools.html).  But we all seem to have our preferences, and lots of small projects working together is mine.
