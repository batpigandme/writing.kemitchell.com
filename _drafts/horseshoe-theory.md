What's going on with new license terms for businesses?

[Redis Labs has some.](https://redislabs.com/community/licenses/)  [Vespene, too.](https://medium.com/@michaeldehaan/going-with-the-commons-clause-1bdab4c15e5d)  [Mongo has some.](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license)  [I've written two.](https://licensezero.com/licenses#public)   [A spiffy new "commercial open source" VC firm wants even more.](https://changelog.com/podcast/320)  Why?

This may feel new.  But its history is as old as open source itself, nearly as old as free software before it.  We are witnessing the natural outcome of a number of long trends in the movements that came together in what we now know as open source.  We are witnessing a self-correcting mechanism at work, responding to imbalances in that movement's recent history.

Even newcomers know that open source can be permissive or copyleft.  But that is not the whole story.  The reasons for those license choices vary more broadly than choice of license suggests.  Licenses implement functionality, as software implements functionality.  Software producers use permissive and copyleft implementations to achieve different goals.

## Permissive

The permissive license user community comprises two recognizable camps.

The BSD School of hackerdom rejects intellectual property and the hassles it creates.  Ideally, BSD School hackers wouldn't need or use licenses at all.  Software would simply be free to use, change, share, and so on.  Permissive licenses like BSD and MIT offer the closest practical approximation.

Meanwhile, established and well capitalized businesses seek free passage through other firms' procurement and compliance protections.  Ideally, software that these businesses provide as loss leaders, share to defray development costs, or popularize for strategic advantage would be easily adopted by any other firm.  Permissive licenses like Apache 2.0 come as close as possible to zero friction in corporate exchange of software.

Both BSD School hackers and enterprises use permissive licenses.  But we see their underlying differences show through in various ways.

Factions of the BSD School choose radically stripped-down versions of old academic licenses like 0BSD and Unlicense, or even grating antilicenses like WTFPL.  Their tone and content scare some enterprise contributors and users away.

Enterprises prefer contract-style licenses that only their lawyers can read, especially those with robust patents terms, including defensive termination terms that give them back their rights to nuclear, if they end up in a standoff.  Length, style, and patent terms rankle BSD School hackers, who like things short and think software patents are evil.

BSD School hackers reject the very legal and contractual regimes that make most enterprise software company's business models possible.  Enterprises abide BSD School hackers' insistence on open software, until it comes to the software they sell.  But both BSD School hackers and enterprises want open source licenses that [reverse legal defaults restricted work with software and source code](https://oss.kemitchell.com/).  Despite deep underlying tensions, the coalition of permissive license users groups remains pretty strong.

## Copyleft

The copyleft license user community also comprises two recognizable camps.
