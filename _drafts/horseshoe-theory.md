What's going on with new license terms for businesses?

[Redis Labs has some.](https://redislabs.com/community/licenses/)  [Vespene, too.](https://medium.com/@michaeldehaan/going-with-the-commons-clause-1bdab4c15e5d)  [Mongo has some.](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license)  [I've written two.](https://licensezero.com/licenses#public)   [A spiffy new "commercial open source" VC firm wants even more.](https://changelog.com/podcast/320)  Why?

This may feel new.  But its history is as old as open source itself, nearly as old as free software before it.  We are witnessing the natural outcome of a number of long trends in the movements that came together in what we now know as open source.  We are witnessing a self-correcting mechanism at work, responding to imbalances in that movement's recent history.

Even newcomers know that open source can be permissive or copyleft.  But that is not the whole story.  The reasons for those license choices vary more broadly than choice of license suggests.  Licenses implement functionality, as software implements functionality.  Software producers use permissive and copyleft implementations to achieve different goals.

## Permissive

The permissive license user community comprises two recognizable camps.

The BSD School of hackerdom rejects intellectual property and the hassles it creates.  Ideally, BSD School hackers wouldn't need or use licenses at all.  Software would simply be free to use, change, share, and so on.  Permissive licenses like BSD and MIT offer the closest practical approximation.

Meanwhile, established and well capitalized businesses seek free passage through other firms' procurement and compliance protections.  Ideally, software that these businesses provide as loss leaders, share to defray development costs, or popularize for strategic advantage would be easily adopted by any other firm.  Permissive licenses like Apache 2.0 come as close as possible to zero friction in corporate exchange of software.

Both BSD School hackers and established businesses use permissive licenses.  But we see their underlying differences show through in various ways.

Factions of the BSD School choose radically stripped-down versions of old academic licenses like 0BSD and Unlicense, or even grating antilicenses like WTFPL.  Their tone and content scare some established business contributors and users away.

Established businesses prefer contract-style licenses that only their lawyers can read, especially those with robust patents terms, including defensive termination terms that give them back their rights to nuclear, if they end up in a standoff.  Length, style, and patent terms rankle BSD School hackers, who like things short and think software patents are evil.

BSD School hackers reject the very legal and contractual regimes that make most established software companies business models possible.  Established businesses abide BSD School hackers' insistence on open software, until it comes to the software they sell.  But both BSD School hackers and established businesses want open source licenses that reverse legal defaults that restrict work with software and source code.

Despite these deep, underlying tensions, the coalition of permissive license users groups remains pretty strong.

## Copyleft

The copyleft license user community also comprises two recognizable camps.

Free software activists reject closed software as an ethical affront.  Ideally, free software activists wouldn't need copyleft licenses at all.  Source code would always be available, free to use, change, share, and so on.  Copyleft licenses like AGPL and GPL come as close as possible, by preventing companies from closing open code, at least some of the time.

Meanwhile, competitive upstarts seek free access to open infrastructure and collaboration in their quests to establish themselves.  Ideally, everyone who uses their work would contribute back, and that value wouldn't simply play into their competitors' preexisting advantages.  Very strong copyleft or "reciprocal" licenses written by businesses, like RPL and OSL, come as close as possible, by requiring sharing work back as open software, which closed software competitors cannot do.  But recently, most upstarts have chosen strong copyleft licenses written by activists, especially AGPL and GPL.

Both software freedom activists and competitive upstarts use copyleft licenses.  But we see their underlying differences show through in various ways.

The most important free software activist organization, the Free Software Foundation, expounds a complex, esoteric, contrarian ideology.  That self-styled philosophy shows through in its licenses. The FSF's preachy preambles and self-imposed limits on requirements to share code back rankle competitive upstarts who don't subscribe to its ideology, and accept shortcomings in license implementation to reap network effects or for inability to write and socialize new licenses.

Software freedom activists look on upstarts' competitiveness and expedience with unease.  They worry about upstarts who use copyleft to give themselves or their firms privileges positions in projects, and often begrudgingly accept the use of their licenses for "dual licensing", or selling private permission to build copyleft code into closed software.  For software freedom activists, copyleft is a means to software freedom, not a tool for excluding others.

Software freedom activists reject the license-based power dynamics that competitive upstarts need.  Competitive upstarts feel dragged into sanctimonious moralizing and long-winded textual mysteries of activist copyleft.  Both software freedom activists and competitive upstarts want license terms that exclude those who refuse to share back.

Despite underlying tensions no more fundamental than those within the permissive license user community, the coalition of copyleft license users is coming apart.

Why?

## Open Source

Ask people affiliated with the Open Source Initiative about free software, and many will tell you that open source isn't really any different from free software.  Free software just preached too much fire and brimstone, missed the rebrand, and lost out.

Ask folks affiliated with the Free Software Foundation about open source, and many will jump to tell how different they are.  Open source strips free software of its values, pandering to the nonfree industry with promises of better, cheaper code, which doesn't happen without unifying community spirit.

That is the common narrative of the Open Source Initiative, the coining of "open source", and the wooing of business.  It's a story told from the points of view of its main characters---OSI and FSF---and their partisans.  Not the users of free software and open source licenses.

The history of bringing open source to companies, and companies to open source, has been one of long, slow, then sudden success.  Since setting up the Open Source Initiative, coining "open source", and forking the Debian Free Software Guidelines to make the Open Source Definition, the effort called "open source" has been a string of less decisive, mixed, and overlapping decisions.

In that history, we can see a trend of the software freedom activist and competitive upstart camps of the copyleft user base slowly peeling away from each other.  The Open Source Initiative has approved every major license published by the Free Software Foundation.  But early in its history, especially circa 2002, OSI and FSF split on a particular kind of license: strong copyleft or "reciprocal" terms, drafted by companies and company-minded lawyers in business-law style, ignoring FSF's self-imposed limits on how much code copyleft could require sharing back, and when.

Relatively few of these licenses remain well known.  Several served as temporary waystations for the specific companies, and sometimes the specific software, for which they were drafted.
