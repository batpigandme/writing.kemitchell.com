What's going on with new license terms for businesses?

[Redis Labs has some.](https://redislabs.com/community/licenses/)  [Vespene, too.](https://medium.com/@michaeldehaan/going-with-the-commons-clause-1bdab4c15e5d)  [Mongo has some.](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license)  [I've written two.](https://licensezero.com/licenses#public)   [A spiffy new "commercial open source" VC firm wants even more.](https://changelog.com/podcast/320)  Why?

This may feel new.  But its history is as old as open source itself, nearly as old as free software before it.  We are witnessing the natural outcome of a number of long trends in the movements that came together in what we now know as open source.  We are witnessing a self-correcting mechanism at work, responding to imbalances in that movement's recent history.

Even newcomers know that open source can be permissive or copyleft.  But that is not the whole story.  The reasons for those license choices vary more broadly than choice of license suggests.  Licenses implement functionality, as software implements functionality.  Software producers use permissive and copyleft implementations to achieve different goals.

The permissive license user group traditionally comprises two camps.

The BSD School of hackerdom rejects intellectual property and the hassles it creates.  Ideally, BSD School hackers wouldn't need or use licenses at all.  Software would simply be free to use, change, share, and so on.  Permissive licenses like BSD and MIT offer the closest practical approximation.

Established and well capitalized businesses seek free passage through other companies' procurement and compliance protections for their software.  Ideally, software that these businesses provide as loss leaders, share to defray development costs, or popularize for strategic advantage would be easy to adopt in any other firm.  Permissive licenses like Apache 2.0 come as close as possible to zero friction in corporate exchange of software.

Both BSD School hackers and well supported companies both use permissive licenses.  But we see them diverge in various ways.  The BSD School and established companies diverge in two ways.  BSD School hackers on extreme variants like the Free Public License, and antilicenses like Unlicense and WTFPL,
