We all love metaphors for open source.  Open source as ecosystem.  Open source as science.  Open source as infrastructure.  And of course we love talking open in the high-flying language of economics.  When we're feeling triumphant, as an exception to all the orthodox rules, as through [Benkler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yochai_Benkler)'s "commons-based peer production".  And when we feel stuck, to invoke economic solutions to our problems, as through [Ostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom)'s "common-pool resources".

But a strange thing happens when open source dogooders talk Ostrom.  They blunt all her hard edges.

In particular, they take the first of her design principles, clear boundaries and memberships, and turn it inside out.  Membership becomes about belonging, about welcoming, about togetherness, about community.  Not about who does and doesn't have the right to use what's made and maintained.  It's a membership that only says "welcome".  It never says "no".  Which is exactly the opposite of the point.

Getting away from hand-wavy summaries and easy-to-glance tables, into the text of Ostrom's book, here is how she specified her first design principle for robust common-pool resources:

> define a set of appropriators who are authorized to use a CPR

Of the studies Ostrom tabulated in her book, five lacked clear boundaries and memberships.  Four of those she classed failures.  The last was "fragile".  Of that last, Ostrom noted:

> Although the rules in devised in Alanya provide an elegant way to solve an assignment problem, they do not address the problem of limiting access to the local fishery.  At the current time, the number of fishers desiring to fish in Alanya does not threaten the viability of the fishery.  But if more individuals were to want access to the fishery, the problem of rent dissipation that characterized Mawelle [which lacked clear boundaries and memberships, and failed] could well arise in Alanya.

Running with the metaphor, Alanya was like a project that's still under the radar.  Its maintainers are making good use of it, but it hasn't been suffocated yet, because outsiders aren't clamoring to exploit it yet.

If by "open source" you mean code that anyone can access and use---that anyone can appropriate---then open source projects fail Ostrom's design criteria for robust common-pool resources by definition.  They may have members and nonmembers, but the difference between them isn't the one that counts.  It's not a boundary of type Ostrom taught us to look for, the kind of boundary she might've counseled us to build, if we want to sustain in a robust way.

Ostrom began her book with a warning against cooking up policy from metaphors.  Her example was nationalizing forests in the Third World, a process of "creating _open-access resources_ where limited-access _common-pool resources_ had previously existed".  This, Ostrom notes, led to "disastrous effects", for which she cites six sources about four different countries.  In Ostrom's terms, an open-access resource is a Hobbesian state of nature where the rules about who can appropriate are no rules at all.  In our terms, an open-access resource is the kind of thing many take open source to be, or think that it ought to be, and think is good for them.

Ostrom _ended_ her book with a warning against policymaking by crisis, with notes on the source of its seductive charm:

> The propensity of political leaders to discuss CPR problems in terms of "crises" is far more understandable once one takes into account that individuals weight perceived harms more heavily than perceived benefits of the same quantity.

In other words, political leaders respond to common-pool crises because they and their constituencies exhibit [loss aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion), a kind of bias or fallacy.  We overreact to harms and things taken away---rights taken out of a license, code held back from public release, features allocated to an "enterprise" version---while downplaying potential benefits, like the prospect of better work, longer sustained, under balanced arrangements of contribution, maintenance, and reward.  What's more, we're short-termist, bad at estimating probabilities, and conservatively hew to familiar rules over new ones, all of which Ostrom points out.

In the end, open source can and should take lessons from Ostrom.  Even though developers aren't fish, forests, water, or game, but individuals, people equally capable of participating in governance as being governed upon.  But those lessons aren't that we should do as we've been doing, without reflection, and trust that a Nobel winner solidly theorized the inevitability our triumph over present funding, motivation, and fairness problems.  Quite the opposite: she theorized, and empirically validated, a pattern that predicts the sustainability _problem_, not its solution.  She cataloged the biases, fallacies, and political traps that would make us blind to the difference.
