I see a parallel to this social dynamic in the permission we tend to give for work we share through with our identities.  Highly permissive Open Source licenses, like [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT), don't care about user affiliation or motivation, either.  Perhaps they're writing tools to uplift a downtrodden indigenous community.  Perhaps they're teaching a robot to play glockenspiel.  Perhaps they're gunning for riches in the belly of the surveillance-industrial beast.  MIT doesn't care.  And as I slap MIT on my own code, thinking of my Internet friends, or more folks like them that I'd like to meet, reasons to care are far from my mind.  If indigenous empowerment, glockenspiel, or dirty money float a friend's boat in the moment, on some fuzzy, general level, I'm all for it.

Building out a life here in Oakland, across the bridge from San Francisco, I landed on a kind of credo:  If I'd help you with some code at [Sudo Room](https://sudoroom.org), the [Transbay Tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transbay_Tube) doesn't make you any less welcome to my code by the time you get to work.  You are you.  Here, there, and everywhere.

Most coders that I talk to---[City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco), [Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California), or [Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley)---like this song.  It resonates with the rapport and idealized independence that we share and celebrate, even if we take public-company jobs with retirement plans and health insurance.  But in part because it feels so easily _right_, because it seems to gather force from subconscious depths, I'm suspicious.  Does this indifference to role and commitment play out in practice as good as it feels?
