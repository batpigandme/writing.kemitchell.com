title: Prone Blogging Setup

Throughout 2018 and 2019 so far, I've suffered repeated bouts of crippling back pain.  In the worst of times, I've been bedridden for days on end, stuck lying in specific positions to avoid constant sciatic torment.  Since I couldn't sit and type at a desk, and I couldn't turn from side to side to read books, I ended up spending a lot of time on an iPhone and an iPad.  Here's the setup I landed on for blogging while stuck lying on one side.

- Sixth Generation iPad
- Working Copy
- iA Writer
- Files
- Jekyll
- GitHub
- Termius
- Anne Pro Keyboard, later Vortexgear Tab60

Working Copy provides Git support on iOS.  I'm particularly fond of the ability to enable empty commit messages, since I rarely write them for small changes to Git repos that I only work on myself.

iA Writer is a simple, serviceable, good-looking Markdown editor.  I actually prefer its modal approach to writing and rendering to Typora's what you see is kind of what you get approach, which I use on my Linux laptop.

Termius supports MOSH, which I prefer for connecting to a remote development machine that I have long had on Linode.  For writing.kemitchell.com, which I host on a DigitalOcean server, rather than on GitHub pages, Termius lets me shell into my dev machine and run the deploy script that publishes the Jekyll site to the web server.

The sixth generation iPad has fairly decent dictation support, though the experience is always a little frustrating.  I find myself dictating basically without reading, and then proofing in a separate pass.

When I'm able to find a comfortable position with hands forward, the bluetooth mechanical keyboard is great.  I'm always a little frustrated by the limited support for keyboard control of the iPad, compared to my Linux systems, but when it comes to churning out prose, it's much the same experience.
