## Line-by-Line

### Title

> License Zero Reciprocal Public License 2.0.1

The license is named for [License Zero].

[License Zero]: https://licensezero.com

The license adopts the three-digit versioning scheme familiar to software developers.

### Notices

> Copyright: [Name the copyright holder in the original version.]

A copyright notice, familiar from most open source licenses.  As under The MIT License, BSD licenses, and many other licenses, users must copy the copyright notice along with copies of the software they provide to others, under the [attribution condition](#attribution).

> Source: [List a URL or instructions to find source code.]

A new kind of notice line, like the copyright notice, but for a different purpose.  Together with the [attribution condition](#attribution), which requires providing this notice along with copies of the software, this notice helps recipients find source if they receive a compiled or other derivative form of the software without source.

### Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability

> \*\*This software comes as is, without any warranty at all.  As far as the law allows, I will not be liable for any damages related to this software or this license, for any kind of legal claim.\*\*

In many jurisdictions, including the United States, contract and other laws imply warranties, or guarantees, about software when it is sold.  Almost all open source software licenses try to reverse, or _disclaim_, all of those implied warranties, while offering no additional warranties on top.

Almost all open source software licenses also attempt to limit contributors' liability to zero.

### Permission

> As long as you meet the conditions below, you may do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe my copyright in it or any covered patent claim.

Open source software licenses free users from concern about two principal kinds of legal threats: lawsuits for infringement of copyright in the software, and lawsuits for infringement of patents covering the software.

> Your permission covers a patent claim that I can license, or become able to license, if you would infringe it by using this software as of my latest contribution.

### Conditions

#### Attribution

> 1.  You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of this software from you, in source code or any other form, also gets the complete text of this license and the copyright and source notices above.

#### Defensive Termination

> 2.  You must not make any legal claim against anyone for infringing any patent claim they would infringe by using this software alone, accusing this software, with or without changes, alone or combined into a larger program.

#### Change Reciprocity

> 3.  If you change this software, you must release source code for your changes.

#### Combination Reciprocity

> 4.  If you combine this software with other software into a larger program, you must release any source code for that larger program that has not yet been released.

#### Developer Tool Reciprocity

> 5.  If you run this software to analyze, change, or generate software, you must release source code for that software that has not yet been released.

### Definition of Release

> Releasing source code means publicly licensing it under either this license or a license approved by the Open Source Initiative, and promptly publishing it, in the preferred form for making changes, to a freely accessible distribution system widely used for similarly licensed source code.

### Automatic Forgiveness

> Any unknowing failure to meet condition 3, 4, or 5 is excused if you release source code as required, or stop doing anything requiring permission under this license, within 30 days of learning that this license required you to release source code.
