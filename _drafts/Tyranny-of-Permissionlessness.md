Philosophically, free and open source licensing means nondiscrimination.  Practically, open source licensing discriminates all the time, against those who rely on exclusive rights that open source requires developers to surrender, and in favor of those with exclusive rights to which open source remains willfully blind.  Adding open source to a stacked-deck game thus further skews the odds in the house's favor, by denying other players their only strong cards.

If you care about open source and need to make money, it's vital to understand how.

## Tunnel Vision

Open source is a very conscious reaction to universal, law-based intellectual property rights: exclusive rights in business-relevant information kept confidential, or trade secrets, exclusive rights in creative work, or copyrights, exclusive rights in useful inventions, or patents, and exclusive rights in names that identify the sources of products and services, or trademarks.  Open source was initially laser-focused on copyright and obliquely trade secret, expanded to address patent, and has acknowledged trademark irregularly, usually to [leave it alone rather than nullify it](https://zoo.kemitchell.com/Apache-2.0#trademarks), but sometimes to [emulate it through other exclusive rights](https://spdx.org/licenses/Zlib.html).

Companies making money on open source, or scoring strategic business victories with it, charge for something other than copyright and patent licenses.  Those making good money enjoy some bulwark---an exclusive right---against competitors who would happily earn less to take a piece of that action.  Open source theory remains willfully blind to the exclusive rights that protect those returns.

For example, in some industries, companies require government approvals, regulatory licenses, or private certifications to do business, legally or practically.  Those rights often apply only to the specific company that obtains them, rather than to its software more generally, and cover organizational as well as technical criteria.  When those rights prove prohibitively expensive or simply impractical for anyone else to obtain, they become effectively exclusive.

Companies holding those exclusive rights can freely release their software as open source.  They hold a greater power---an effectively exclusive right to do business with the software---that makes the lesser power of licensing irrelevant.  Having released as open source, firm developers can leverage free infrastructure, like code hosting, testing, and distribution. The firm can use open source participation and open source work style to recruit developers who like open source.  Outside contributions may even show up with patches now and then.  But outsiders aren't free to operationalize or commercialize the results without approval, license, or certification of their own, Impossible is that maybe to get.  Overall, the system discriminates against them.  But the software is "open source", because open source doesn't reach the dimension where exclusion occurs.

## Limitations

Open source can be forgiven for failing to address such constraints when its signature tool, public licensing, can't touch it.  No foundation or private firm can nullify superior authority's public policy in a form license unless permitted to do so by its rules, as for copyleft.  Changing effective public policy requires lobbying, legislation, litigation, or some combination of all three.

This is partly the case with patents.  An open source license can only grant permission for patents that contributors can license.  It can't grant permission for patents owned by others not involved in making the implementation available.  If you patent a process and I implement it in open source software, I can't license your patent to users of my implementation without your permission, even if I choose a license with the broadest possible broad patent grant, like [the one in Blue Oak Model License](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0#patent).  Open source licenses do what they can, but in the end it's up to political action groups to change patent law.

But exclusive rights may also be entirely within the control of the firms that exploit them.  When those firms really software, the terms under which they do so could nullify those exclusive rights.  Open source license terms don't.

Some firms dominate whole commercial categories due to overwhelming brand recognition, entrenched and exclusive relationships, or market power.  These firms occupy swathes of customer brain space in the addressable market, as vendors occupy booth space on a trade show floor.  They stack the odds of the competitive games they play like owners stack the odds at a casino.  So even if a competitor has every right needed to offer a competing product or service, they may be utterly unable to make it known, make a sale, or meet an entrenched incumbent on their own terms.

## Breakaway

When business theorists speak of "network effects", they mean rights that are not only exclusive, but compound on themselves.  They speak of an antidote to, or protection from, competition, in the ability of network effects to compound so quickly that a firm eclipses all rivals.

Software companies benefiting from strong network effects can be prolific producers of open source software.  They can be, having graduated to a level of competitive advantage that makes copyright and perhaps even patent---the whole blinkered view of open source---not just redundant, but needlessly complicating.  Why leverage public licensing, which affects customers as well as competitors, when you can target competitors selectively?  Why leverage public licensing, which is publicly visible, when you can protect your position without ever acknowledging how?

## Elephant Duel

We learn how when giant takes on giant.

Consider Kubernetes.  Perhaps it's truly revolutionary technology, a demonstrable step change over what came before.  It's certainly well promoted that way.  So much so that a great number of those enthusiastically riding this new wave of the orchestrated future clearly haven't any objective need for its scalability or complexity, for their use cases.  But the name recognition and technical reputation of Google, the massive budget Google has thrust behind it, and the dynamics of new-hotness in software engineering all conspire to make Kubernetes an industry force.  There is apparently nothing Amazon, a behemoth in other forms of consumer and developer attention, not to mention the counter party of an existing commercial cloud services contract with basically everybody, can do about it.

That was utterly calculated.  Google pushes Kubernetes to crack open the market dominance of Amazon Web Services.  [Here's their man saying so in a public conference talk, complete with heartfelt assurance that wearing the motive on their sleeve was key to their success forming a foundation.](https://youtu.be/L7WKHLpm4wc?t=156)

These are the lumbering, heavy blows of tech titans, wielding budgets and strategic heavy weapons smaller firms can't lift.  What about the little guys?  Smaller players are relevant to titans only en mass, insofar as the herd can be made to stampede in one direction or another.  But that's an instrumental part.  What tools could they possibly have with which to compete?

## People Powers

There is one universal exclusive right in software, bestowed on the common man as well as the multinational.  Creators of software have the right to share it, or to keep it secret.

The "source" part of "open source" requires surrendering this privilege, and completely.  Merely granting a well known license for something less than the preferred form for making changes---say, obfuscated source or compiled binary---doesn't count.

Copyright is only slightly less universal.  Under US law, copyright applies to nearly any source code, so long as it evidences some degree of creativity, which is not a lot.  There's no need to file any application, or pay any fee, to receive exclusive copyright, at least until you need to sue.

As usual, there are laws that make employers and clients the owners of copyright, rather than the original authors, when authors work for employees and clients.  But by default, and outside the work environment, especially in states like California with specific legal protections for independent work, copyright belongs to the author.  That is to say, copyright belongs to the programmer.

Individuals can and do use copyright power to shape the behavior of behemoth firms with respect to their source code.  The system isn't perfect.  Enforcement isn't free.  But if large firms had no reason to fear the license choices of two-bit hackers, they wouldn't spend so much time, treasure, and process identifying complying with them. Some of their incentive is legal, and some of it is not.  But overall, the affect as leverage.

Applying open source license, and that leverage is gone. All else being equal, if you hand a large firm all the rights in your work that you have, and they enjoy exclusive rights that you don't, you have invited competition on unlevel level playing fiels, running uphill. You have taken a handicap, and they can take your code.  Odds.  favored them to begin with.

## Purpose

Open source's popularity has become its own justification.  But before widespread acceptance, open source had a purpose.  Its attack on exclusive intellectual property rights had a purpose.

That purpose is less and less well served by a dated, myopic view of the kinds of exclusion that pose a threat to end-user control and lively competition.  A more holistic view, exceeding that shortsightedness, would account for, and nullify, a far broader range of exclusive privileges, legal and commercial. We're available tools, like public licensing, fail to reach key elements of that system, it would permit retention of exclusive rights, even exclusive rights at the core of historical open source, like copyright and patent, For offsetting leverage against forms of exclusion that can't be brought in scope.
