Philosophically, free and open source licensing means non-discrimination.  Practically, open source licensing discriminates all the time, against those who rely on exclusive rights that open source requires we surrender, and in favor of those with exclusive rights to which open source remains willfully blind.  Adding open source to a stacked-deck game thus further skews the odds in the dealer's favor, by denying other players strong cards. 

Companies making money on open source, or scoring strategic business victories through it, charge for something other than licenses.  Those making good money have some bulwark---an exclusive right---against competitors who would happily earn less to take a piece of that action.

Open source is very conscious reaction to universal, law-based exclusive rights: copyrights, exclusive rights in creative work, patents, exclusive rights in useful inventions, and trademarks, exclusive rights in names that identify the sources of products and services.  Open source was initially laser-focused on copyright, expanded to address patent, and has acknowledged trademark irregularly, usually to [leave it alone](https://zoo.kemitchell.com/Apache-2.0#trademarks), but sometimes to [emulate it with other exclusive rights](https://spdx.org/licenses/Zlib.html).

Open source theory remains willfully blind to exclusive rights outside intellectual property.

For example, in some industries, companies require government approvals, regulatory licenses, or private certifications to do business.  Those rights often apply only to the specific company that obtains them, rather than to its software more generally, and cover organizational as well as technical criteria.  When those rights prove prohibitively expensive or simply impractical for anyone else to obtain, they become effectively exclusive.

Companies holding those exclusive rights can freely release their software as open source.  They hold a greater power---an effectively exclusive right to do business with that software---that makes the lesser power of licensing irrelevant.  Having released as open source, developers can leverage free infrastructure, like code hosting, testing, and distribution.  Contributions may even come back from outside the firm.  But other contributors aren't free to operationalize or commercialize the results without approval, license, or certification.  Overall, the system discriminates against them.  But the software is "open source", because open source doesn't exist in the dimension where discriminatory exclusion occurs.

Open source can be forgiven for failing to address those constraints, because it can't.  No foundation or private firm can nullify superior authority's rules.  That requires lobbying, legislation, litigation, or some combination of all three.

This is partly the case with patents.  An open source license can only grant permission for patents that contributors can license.  It can't grant permission for patents owned by others not involved in making the open source implementation available.  If you patent a process and I implement it in open source software, I can't license your patent to users of my implementation, even if I choose a license with the broadest possible broad patent grant, like [the one in Blue Oak Model License](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0#patent).  Open source licenses do what they can, but in the end it's up to political action groups to change patent law.

But exclusive rights may also be entirely within the control of the firms that exploit them.  Some firms dominate whole commercial categories due to overwhelming brand recognition, entrenched and exclusive relationships, or market power.  These firms occupy swathes of customer brain space in the addressable market, as vendors occupy booth spaces on a trade-show floor.  They stack the odds of the competitive games they play like owners stack the odds at a casino.  Even if a competitor has every right needed to offer a competing product or service, they may be utterly unable to make it known, make a sale, or meet an entrenched incumbent on their terms.

When business theorists speak of "network effects", they mean rights that are not only exclusive, but compound on themselves.  They speak of an antidote to, or protection from, competition, in the ability of network effects to compound so quickly that a firm breaks away from all rivals.

Software companies benefiting from strong network effects are prolific sources of open source software.  They can be, having graduated to a level of competitive advantage that makes copyright and perhaps even patent---the whole blinkered view of open source---not just redundant, but needlessly complicating.  Why leverage licensing, which affects customers as well as competitors, when you can target competitors selectively?  Why leverage licensing, which is publicly visible, when you can protect your position without ever acknowledging how?

Consider Kubernetes.  Perhaps it's good technology, a true step change from what came before.  It's certainly well promoted that way.  So much so that a great number of those enthusiastically riding this new wave of the orchestrated future have clearly no need for its complexity, given their size and use cases.  But the name recognition and technical reputation of Google, the massive budget Google has thrust behind it, and the dynamics of new-hotness in software engineering all conspire to make Kubernetes an industry force.  There is apparently nothing Amazon, a behemoth in other forms of customer attention, can do about it.

That was utterly calculated.  Google pushes Kubernetes to crack open the market dominance of Amazon Web Services.  [Here's their man saying so in a public conference talk, complete with heartfelt assurance that wearing the motive on their sleeve was key to their success forming a foundation.](https://youtu.be/L7WKHLpm4wc?t=156)

These are the lumbering, heavy blows of tech titans, wielding budgets and strategic heavy weapons smaller firms can't lift.  What about the little guys?  What tools could they possibly have with which to compete?

There is one universal exclusive right in software, bestowed on the common man as well as the multinational.  Creators of software have the right to share it, or to keep it secret.  The "source" part of "open source" requires surrendering this privilege.  Merely granting a well known license for something less---say, obfuscated source or compiled binary---doesn't count.

Copyright is only slightly less universal.  Under US law, copyright applies to nearly any code, so long as it evidences some degree of creativity, which is not a lot.  There's no need to file any application, or pay any fee, to receive exclusive copyright, at least until you need to sue.

As usual, there are laws that make employers and clients the owners of copyright, rather than the original authors, when authors work for employees and clients. But by default, and outside the work environment, especially in states like California with specific legal protections for independent work, copyright belongs to the author.  That is to say, copyright belongs to the programmer.
