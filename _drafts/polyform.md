Together with my colleagues, I'm proud to announce [The Polyform Project](https://polyformproject.org/), a new project to publish simple, standard, plain-language software source code licenses.

Polyform looks to fill the gaps in standardized software licensing.  Creators of art and film and music have a full range of standardized licenses to choose from, from Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivatives through to public domain dedication.  Largely for historical reasons, standardization has only blessed the permissive and copyleft sides of public software licensing.

I've done some work bridging those gaps in the past, most notably with [Prosperity](https://polyformproject.org/), a direct adaptation of Creative Commons' Non Commercial language to software licensing, for [License Zero](https://licensezero.com).  I've seen a surprising amount of interest in, and use of, that form since.
