title: Decentralization of Responsibility

Law is applied history.  "Decentralize to avoid the law" is ahistorical.  Decentralization buys leverage, at least for those who last long enough to sit at the settlement table.  But the end result _is_ settlement, not a bullet hole through public policy.

## The Decentralization Game

The government enforces some laws, like criminal laws.  The government leaves private parties to enforce other laws, like most of the Copyright Act.  The players are different, but the game is played the same:

- White:  Implements the system as simply as possible, under one company's operational and legal control.  Proves the concept, and delivers value, partially illicit.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes the company for breaking the law and flaunting public policy.  Forces the company to shut the system down.

- White:  Reimplements without unitary operational control,  decentralizing, distributing, federating, and standardizing its functional aspects.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes those developing, maintaining, and facilitating the reimplemented system, for helping others break the law and flaunt public policy.  Forces them to stop, or if that's not possible, burdens and constrains them.

- White:  Decentralizes, distributes, federates, and standardizes the way the system is made, maintained, and facilitated.  Or, if feasible, meets the burdens and constraints imposed by law.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes end users of the system, for breaking the law and flaunting public policy.  Pursues them ruthlessly, to make public examples, and frightens other users they can't afford to sue or prosecute en masse.

- White & Black:  Negotiate a compromise, within the law.  Jointly herd users toward the compromise system, which is often easy, since the compromise system needn't complicate itself in operation or control to avoid getting shut down, and works well.

File sharing services and the entertainment industry played this game in my youth.  Websites posted music and video files online, but websites could be shut down with one fell legal stroke.  Napster distributed the burden of compiling and distributing content, but not peer discovery or search, and the music industry shut Napster down.  Second-generation P2P file sharing apps distributed peer discovery and search.  The courts held that technologies with substantial noninfringing uses could not be shut down for all users indiscriminately.  So the content industry publicly and ruthlessly sued individual users of file sharing applications.  In the end, companies like Apple and Amazon brokered deals for legal sales of media files in online stores, the combined seller-producer coalition promoted those stores, and users came to turn to them first.

But the game has been played many times.  Printing presses.  Sheet music.  Piano rolls.  Phonograph recorders.  Tape recorders.  Video cassette recorders.  We will play it again in my lifetime.  Likely several times.

## The Policy Game

Looking back, we see that the game's politics follow a pattern, too:

- White:  Decries the law as poorly implemented, overreaching, technically ignorant, anti-competitive, and corrupt.

- Black:  Counters that White wrongly short-shrifts, or simply ignores, the policy thrust of the law, disrupting a settled compromise achieved through legitimate political process.

- White:  Pleads technical infeasibility, and accuses law of strangling an emerging technical advancement.

- Black:  Counters that White ducks responsibility for designing systems responsive to the thrust of the law, pointing to past examples of successful compromise systems.

In rare cases, the leverage decentralization buys moves policy.  But in the run of games, the law adapts to the technology, as by court decision, rather than forcing a rewrite of the legal regime or a revision of underlying public policy.  Napster begat case law about secondary copyright liability, the limits of responsibility for helping others infringe copyright.  But it didn't change the fundamental policy behind copyright law, or the basic written structure of the Copyright Act.

## The Business Game

Good tech is good business, and the rules of the operational, legal, and political decentralization games have etched themselves into business as we know it.  The prospects of a network technology change over time:  high in risk, with low probability of long-term reward, in the initial, centralized stage, then lower in risk and high in reward, in the similarly centralized, later compromise stage.

A large business aims to catch the technical wave early enough to earn a seat at the settlement table, but not so early that the company, or its customers, catch Hell.  When a company steps in too early, it puts its whole value at stake, not just the value of the part dabbling with new tech.  That's often far more to risk than to gain.  So risk management---as compliance, accounting, legal, or business strategy---sets up all manner of internal controls and checkpoints to keep the would-be entrepreneurs on payroll from wagering the good corporate name to make their own.  But when a company steps in too late, it lacks the expertise and connections to hold itself out as a credible candidate for compromise counterparty.

The middle stages, decentralized operation and facilitation, poorly match large enterprises' native work style.  Their instincts to capture and protect business value tend to strangle opportunities based on loose confederation.

To bridge this gap, enterprises use start-up companies, and to a lesser extent autonomous subsidiaries and skunkworks projects.  Speculative projects don't have public money to safeguard, eschew risk management for focused, risky gambles, and attract the kind of personalities capable of biting their way to the top of a dogpile.  The endgame of most start-up companies is sale to an established company with access to public capital.  Such companies are more than happy to foot the bill for the financiers---founders and venture capitalists---who kept the dog in the fight.

Acquisition begins a process of reform and reconciliation.  From a public policy standpoint, start-up companies running headlong at settled legal compromises operate antisocially.
