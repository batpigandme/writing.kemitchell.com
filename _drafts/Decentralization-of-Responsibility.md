title: Decentralization of Responsibility

"Decentralization trumps bad law" is ahistorical.  Decentralization can shake a status quo.  But in the end, competing interests seek stability, and decentralization leverage usually accrues to centralized enterprises willing and able to cut new, stable, coalition deals with the interests the law tries to balance. The end result is nearly always a new equilibrium within the established legal framework, not a gaping decentralization-shaped hole in public policy.

If decentralization matters to you because centralization runs counter to your values, the lesson of history is that you can't win by decentralizing hard enough.  If you run headlong at the law, without regard for the balance of interests it represents, and design your systems antisocially, you may get lucky and earn big for creating a chance to redistribute wealth, but you're unlikely to work lasting structural change.  To decentralize systems and keep them that way, we have to understand what we challenge, and learn to build systems that take responsibility for providing better outcomes.

You can use decentralization to destabilize an existing balance of power. But be prepared either to offer a livable balance on the other side, or to see your kind of progress reversed.

# The Decentralization Game

The government enforces some laws, like drug laws, and leaves private parties to enforce others, like most of the Copyright Act.  The players are different, but the game is played mostly the same:

- White:  Implements the system as simply as possible, under unitary operational and legal control, often one company.  Proves the concept and delivers value, at least partially illicit.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes the unitary controller for breaking the law and flaunting public policy.  Forces it to shut the system down.

- White:  Reimplements without unitary operational control,  decentralizing, distributing, federating, and standardizing functional aspects of the system.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes those developing, maintaining, facilitating, and popularizing the reimplemented system for helping others break the law and flaunt public policy.  Forces them to stop, or if that's not possible, burdens and constrains them.

- White:  If feasible, meets imposed burdens and constraints.  Otherwise, decentralizes, distributes, federates, and standardizes the way the system is made, maintained, and facilitated.  

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes end users of the system for breaking the law and flaunting public policy.  Pursues them ruthlessly, to make public examples and frighten all the other users they can't afford to pursue.

- White & Black:  Negotiate a compromise, within the law.  Jointly herd users toward the compromise system, which is often better, since it doesn't have to navigate the constraints developers in earlier turns of the game.

File sharing services and the entertainment industry played this game in my youth.  Websites posted music and video files online, but websites could be shut down with one fell legal stroke.  Napster distributed the burden of compiling and distributing content, but not peer discovery or search, and the music industry shut Napster down.  Second-generation P2P file sharing apps distributed peer discovery and search.  The courts held that technologies with substantial noninfringing uses could not be shut down for all users indiscriminately.  So the content industry publicly and ruthlessly sued individual users of file sharing applications.  In the end, companies like Apple brokered deals for legal sales of media files in online stores, the combined seller-producer coalition promoted those stores, and users came to turn to them first.

This game has been played many times.  Printing presses.  Sheet music.  Piano rolls.  Phonograph recorders.  Tape recorders.  Video cassette recorders.

We will play several more rounds in my lifetime.  E-commerce.  Social networks. Payments.  And so on. Stakes will remain high.

# The Policy Game

Politics connect policy to law.  Looking back, we see that the decentralization game follows a pattern in the political dimension, too:

- White:  Decries applicable law as poorly implemented, overreaching, technically ignorant, anti-competitive, and corrupt.

  > Copyright law is bad public policy that affects too much work, doesn't anticipate cheap copying via computer technology, serves big content companies, and got written largely at their bidding.

- Black:  Counters that White wrongly short-shrifts, or outright ignores, the basic fairness and policy thrust of the law, disrupting a settled compromise achieved through established political process.

  > Copyright law ensures that artists, producers, and the companies that bankroll them get compensated.  File sharing advocates just want free music, at everyone else's expense.

- White:  Pleads technical infeasibility, and accuses law of strangling an emerging technical advancement.

  > Computer systems will only get better at making copies, and DRM is fundamentally flawed. Rigorously enforcing current copyright law only helps the content industry keep the market locked into physical-media distribution, when all the technology for distribution over the 'Net already exists.

- Black:  Counters that White ducks responsibility for designing systems responsive to public policy, pointing to past examples of successful compromise systems.

  > All the technology for _free_ distribution exists, but not infrastructure that helps artists get paid for the value they deliver. In the past, technology and service companies helped the music industry administer a massive system of royalty calculations and disbursements, which makes artists tons of money each year.

In rare cases, the leverage decentralization buys moves policy itself.  But in the run of games, the law adapts to the technology, as by court decision, rather than forcing a rewrite of the legal regime or a revision of underlying public policy.  Napster begat case law about secondary copyright liability, the limits of responsibility for providing others tools with which they could infringe.  But it didn't change the fundamental policy behind copyright law, or the basic written structure of the Copyright Act:

> To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.

When decentralization does affect policy, the effect usually comes at the compromise stage.  White and Black enshrine their compromise in the law.  Under the Copyright Act, we see that in provisions like compulsory licensing: situations where owners of rights _have_ to license use of their work, but get paid an amount set by law.

Law changes this way, rather than buckling under new technology, because the people and interest groups invested in prior compromises, embedded in the law and the systems built up around it, don't just disappear.  In fact, they're often far better at expressing themselves through the political process than upstart newcomers.  When decentralizers present themselves as a threat, as shock troops, they're often far more motivated, as well.  It's that much easier to rally against a common, credible threat.

# The Business Game

Manufacturing opportunities to redistribute wealth is good business.  Business practice reflects this.

The enterprise opportunity of a network technology changes over time:  High in risk, with low probability of long-term reward, in the initial, centralized stage, before decentralization. Then low in risk and high in reward, in the similarly centralized but more competitive compromise stage, when the uncertainty created by decentralization creates opportunity.  A large business aims to catch the technical wave early enough to earn a seat at the compromise table, but not so early that the company, or its customers, catch Hell.

When an established company steps in too early, it puts its whole value and reputation at stake.  Risk management---compliance, accounting, legal, and so on---keeps would-be entrepreneurs on payroll from wagering the good corporate name to make their own.  Large companies therefore come late to iconoclastic decentralization movements, by institutional design.  When risk management functions normally, large companies lack the expertise and connections to hold themselves out as credible saviors from the lawless, decentralized fray.  No iPod, no iTunes.

Of course, the middle, decentralized stages also run crosswise with enterprise-scale operations.  Their instincts to capture and protect business value tend to strangle opportunities based on loose confederation.  Their management hierarchies drive off risk-hungry helions who excel in chaotic conditions.  Enterprises are big structure, and they breed more big structure.  Destabilization is not their forte.

To fill this capability gap, enterprises use start-up companies, and to a lesser extent risk-shielded, autonomous subsidiaries and secret skunkworks projects, to pressure incumbents and capture released value.  Speculative ventures don't have public money or trust to safeguard, eschew risk management for focused, risky gambles, and attract the kind of Wild West personalities bred to claw to the top of a dogpile.

But the endgame of most start-up companies is sale to an established concern with access to public capital.  They sell out.  Established concerns happily foot the bill---from founders, venture capitalists, and so on---for packaging up that opportunity for sale.  In part because the value acquired by assimilating a start-up is different in kind from what enterprises can produce for themselves.  They can't _do_ destabilization. But big companies, and to a lesser extent the public markets, via IPOs, are the only ones who can afford to buy it out.

Acquisition, or going public, begins a process of reconciliation.  From a public policy standpoint, start-up companies running headlong at settled markets operate antisocially, and often at the edge of legality.  Adherence to public-company risk management and work style comes as a calculated shock.  M&A typically features executive retention, but founders often depart as soon as they can.  Ideally, after they've done their part to help the acquirer broker a new, stable compromise with other stakeholders.

# Metagame

The decentralization game as we know it plays great for those served well by venture-backed multiples and entrenched public-company compromise cease-fires.  If that's you, skip the rest, and treat yourself a drink. The part describing how things _are_ and _have been_ is over, and it's all good news for you so far.

The decentralization game does _not_ play well for those who favor decentralization, variously defined, because decentralization favors values like end-user privacy and autonomy, however defined.  Whatever gains the decentralization game achieves for those values rolls back when systems recentralize.  In the medium term, decentralization serves just as a catalyst, dissolving the status quo long enough to recrystalize wealth, control, and information in a slightly different lattice. Maybe that redistribution has value-positive secondary effects.  Very often the opposite.

A few thoughts. Call them opportunities.

## Minimize Collateral Damage

If you swing into an established market like a wrecking ball, you won't be first draft to put the pieces back together. The more collateral damage you inflict, the less your architecture credentials shine.  The less your preferences will affect the design of the new, stable system, to the extent that reflects personal discretion.

Minimize collateral damage by approaching the game as a negotiation, rather than a conquest.  Decentralizing some or all of an existing system, or even merely demonstrating that's possible, can earn you leverage.  Incumbents that otherwise wouldn't give you time of day may engage.  But in the end, you need a coalition and a new normal that most of the political will in the system can accept.  There will be winners and losers.  There always are.  But resilient interest groups don't just disappear or dissipate.  A splash of decentralization won't melt them on contact, like the Wicked Witch of the West.

As in any negotiation, you want to study your starting point and prior deals.  That includes prior cycles of decentralization. _Why_ is the system the way it is now?  Sometimes, the answer will be at least partially illegitimate: unexamined tradition, practical miscalculation, corruption, changed circumstances.  But one fault doesn't damn the whole structure.  Even if a system was perverse from conception, the test is whether it endured.  Identify as many groups affected as you can, and feel out how the current normal offsets tension between them, statically and dynamically.

It's damn difficult mapping out all the stakeholder constituencies in a complex system, especially when they've been quiet, on ceasefire, for some time, and not fighting loudly in court or the press.  But that is exactly the map you need to navigate for a new compromise.  Try not to piss off the people you need.  Take pains to show understanding and respect for their stake in the game.  Know their point of view well enough to anticipate when your actions might come across, unintentionally, as an assault on their position.

## Avoid Tunnel Vision

Most decentralization activists that I know believe they champion universal benefits.  Privacy protects everyone.  Autonomy empowers everyone.  Resilience supports everyone.

How much?

Even if you think it's broken, mismanaged, corrupt, and stupid, if the stakes in the current standoff are high, that's probably because utility and reliance are, too.  If decentralization means trading off some of that existing utility, even temporarily---because your system is new and immature, because decentralization requires it, technically---the benefit of decentralization has to offset that loss.  More than that, it has to be as compelling, visible, and well articulated as what is lost.

In other words, don't assume anyone cares about your values, or your approach to serving them, as you do.  You will probably need some users who aren't allied in your values to form a new coalition around a more decentralized administration.  You will probably need to make some new converts to your values, by convincing them more or less from scratch.  If it's worth decentralizing, there are probably lots of folks using it who have never heard the word "decentralization".

## Know What Business Knows

Most decentralization efforts don't attract much attention at all. Those that do enjoy momentum both from allies motivated by shared values, and from businesspeople who know the game. There's nothing inherently poisonous about the latter. Arguably, any new, more decentralized stable state will need some opportunists, to build its alternative and make its coalition.

All the usual cautions about speculation and other people's money remain in full effect. Beware of situations where you receive support or attention for one reason, and prefer, on a very basic, human, psychological level, to pretend it's for another, or to simply avoid thinking about it.  When you build a team, take investment, or share governance, do your due diligence.  If you work with business, you'll need to be good at business.  When you play the business game, business rules apply.

That is not to say that you won't find allies or meaningful support through business channels. Investment can be a form of activism, and shooting even purely profit-motivated structure, acumen, and experience into an idealistic venture can produce more success for all involved.  Values-driven decentralization and entrepreneurship can and do coincide.  As always, the trouble is telling good opportunities from bad.

# Overall

God for it.  Nobody can stop you, and I'm definitely not here to talk you out of it.

But read your history, and try to learn from it. Know the game to change the game.
