title: Decentralization of Responsibility

"Decentralize around the law" is ahistorical. Decentralization can shake a status quo.  But in the end, competing interests seek stability, and decentralization leverage usually accrues to centralized enterprises willing and able to cut new, stable, coalition deals with incumbents. The end result is nearly always a new equilibrium within the established legal framework, not a gaping decentralization-shaped hole in public policy.

If decentralization matters to you because centralization runs counter to your values, the lesson of history is to get wise.  If you run headlong at the law, without regard for the balance of interests it represents, and design your systems indifferently, you may get lucky and earn big for creating a chance to redistribute wealth, but you're unlikely to work lasting structural change.  To decentralize systems and keep them that way, we have to understand the steady states we challenge, and learn to build systems that take responsibility for balancing interests, from creator compensation to tax to public safety.  Decentralized systems have to offer liveable steady-state compromises to incumbents who lose out by decentralization, but don't simply disappear.

## The Decentralization Game

The government enforces some laws, like drug laws, and leaves private parties to enforce others, like most of the Copyright Act.  The players are different, but the game is played  mostly the same:

- White:  Implements the system as simply as possible, under one company's operational and legal control.  Proves the concept and delivers value, at least partially illicit.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes the company for breaking the law and flaunting public policy.  Forces the company to shut the system down.

- White:  Reimplements without unitary operational control,  decentralizing, distributing, federating, and standardizing functional aspects of the system.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes those developing, maintaining, and facilitating the reimplemented system, for helping others break the law and flaunt public policy.  Forces them to stop, or if that's not possible, burdens and constrains them.

- White:  Decentralizes, distributes, federates, and standardizes the way the system is made, maintained, and facilitated.  Or, if feasible, meets imposed burdens and constraints.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes end users of the system for breaking the law and flaunting public policy.  Pursues them ruthlessly, to make public examples, and frightens other users they can't afford to sue or prosecute en masse.

- White & Black:  Negotiate a compromise, within the law.  Jointly herd users toward the compromise system, which is often easy, since the compromise system needn't complicate itself in operation or control to avoid getting shut down.

File sharing services and the entertainment industry played this game in my youth.  Websites posted music and video files online, but websites could be shut down with one fell legal stroke.  Napster distributed the burden of compiling and distributing content, but not peer discovery or search, and the music industry shut Napster down.  Second-generation P2P file sharing apps distributed peer discovery and search.  The courts held that technologies with substantial noninfringing uses could not be shut down for all users indiscriminately.  So the content industry publicly and ruthlessly sued individual users of file sharing applications.  In the end, companies like Apple brokered deals for legal sales of media files in online stores, the combined seller-producer coalition promoted those stores, and users came to turn to them first.

But the game has been played many times.  Printing presses.  Sheet music.  Piano rolls.  Phonograph recorders.  Tape recorders.  Video cassette recorders.  We will play it again in my lifetime.  Likely several times.  For e-commerce.  For social networks. And so on.

## The Policy Game

Looking back, we see that the game's politics follow a pattern, too:

- White:  Decries applicable law as poorly implemented, overreaching, technically ignorant, anti-competitive, and corrupt.

- Black:  Counters that White wrongly short-shrifts, or outright ignores, the policy thrust of the law, disrupting a settled compromise achieved through established political process.

- White:  Pleads technical infeasibility, and accuses law of strangling an emerging technical advancement.

- Black:  Counters that White ducks responsibility for designing systems responsive to the thrust of the law, pointing to past examples of successful compromise systems.

In rare cases, the leverage decentralization buys moves policy.  But in the run of games, the law adapts to the technology, as by court decision, rather than forcing a rewrite of the legal regime or a revision of underlying public policy.  Napster begat case law about secondary copyright liability, the limits of responsibility for providing others tools with which they could infringe.  But it didn't change the fundamental policy behind copyright law, or the basic written structure of the Copyright Act.

When decentralization _does_ affect policy, the effect usually comes at the compromise stage.  White and Black enshrine their compromise in the law.  Under the Copyright Act, we see that in provisions like compulsory licensing.

Law changes this way, rather than bowing to new technology, because the people and interest groups invested in the prior compromise, embedded in the law and the systems built up around it, don't disappear.  In fact, they're often far better at expressing themselves through the policy-making process than upstart newcomers.

Politics and lobbying aside, fundamental interests don't usually change.  Authors still need protection to secure compensation for their work.  Companies set up to consolidate and administer artists' financial interests don't turn tail at first sign of compelling new technology.

## The Business Game

Manufacturing opportunities to redistribute wealth is good business.  So the rules of operational, legal, and political decentralization have etched themselves into industry.

The enterprise opportunity of a network technology changes over time:  high in risk, with low probability of long-term reward, in the initial, centralized stage, before decentralization, then lower in risk and high in reward, in the similarly centralized but more competitive compromise stage.  A large business aims to catch the technical wave early enough to earn a seat at the compromise table, but not so early that the company, or its customers, catch Hell.

When an established company steps in too early, it puts its whole value and reputation at stake.  Risk management---compliance, accounting, legal, and so on---keeps would-be entrepreneurs on payroll from wagering the good corporate name to make their own.  Large companies therefore come late to iconoclastic decentralization drives, by conscious design.  When risk management functions normally, large companies lack the expertise and connections to hold themselves out as credible rescuers from the lawless fray.  No iPod, no iTunes.

Of course, the middle, decentralized stages also run crosswise with enterprise-scale operations.  Their instincts to capture and protect business value tend to strangle opportunities based on loose confederation.  Their management hierarchies drive off risk-hungry helions who excel in chaos.

To bridge this gap, enterprises use start-up companies, and to a lesser extent risk-shielded, autonomous subsidiaries and secret skunkworks projects, to pressure incumbents and capture released value.  Speculative ventures don't have public money to safeguard, eschew risk management for focused, risky gambles, and attract the kind of Wild West personalities bred to claw up dogpiles, rather than win out by attrition.  But the endgame of most start-up companies is sale to an established concern with public capital.  Such concerns happily foot the financial bill---from founders, venture capitalists, and so on---for packaging up the opportunity for sale.  In part because the value acquired by assimilating a start-up is different in kind from what enterprise can do for themselves.

Acquisition begins a process of reconciliation.  From a public policy standpoint, start-up companies running headlong at settled business systems operate antisocially, and often at the edge of legality.  Adherence to big-company risk management and work style comes as a calculated shock.  M&A typically features executive retention, but founders often depart as soon as they can.  Ideally, after they've been tapped to help the acquirer broker a compromise with other stakeholders.

## Metagame

This system works for those who benefit by venture-backed multiples and entrenched public-company compromise cease-fires.  It does not work for those who favor "decentralization", variously defined, because decentralization favors values like end-user privacy or autonomy.  The typical endgame is centralized, if possibly competitive, services.  Decentralization is but a catalyst, destabilizing the status quo long enough to recrystalize wealth and control in a slightly different pattern.  A means to a reallocation, but not a structural end in itself.

Centralized enterprises offer a compliant, socially conscious alternative to decentralizers run amok.
