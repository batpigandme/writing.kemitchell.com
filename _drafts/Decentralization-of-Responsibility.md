title: Decentralization of Responsibility

Law is applied history.  "Decentralize to avoid the law" is ahistorical.  Decentralization buys leverage, at least for those who last long enough to sit at the settlement table.  The result is compromise, not a bullet hole through public policy.

The government enforces some laws, like criminal laws.  The government leaves private parties to enforce other laws, like most of the Copyright Act.  In either case, the game plays out largely the same:

- White:  Implements the system as simply as possible, under one company's operational and legal control.  Proves the concept, and delivers value.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes the company for breaking the law and flaunting public policy.  Forces the company to shut the system down.

- White:  Reimplements without unitary operational control,  decentralizing, distributing, federating, and standardizing its functional aspects.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes those developing, maintaining, and facilitating the reimplemented system, for helping others break the law and flaunt public policy.  Forces them to stop, or if that's not possible, burdens and constrains them.

- White:  Decentralizes, distributes, federates, and standardizes the way the system is made, maintained, and facilitated.  Or, if feasible, meets the burdens and constraints imposed by law.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes end users of the system, for breaking the law and flaunting public policy.  Pursues them ruthlessly, to make public examples, and frightens other users they can't afford to sue or prosecute en masse.

- White & Black:  Negotiate a compromise, within the law.  Jointly herd users toward the compromise system, which is often easy, since the compromise system needn't complicate itself in operation or control to avoid getting shut down, and works well.

File sharing services and the entertainment industry played this game in my youth.  Websites posted music and video files online, but websites could be shut down with one fell legal stroke.  Napster distributed the burden of compiling and distributing content, but not peer discovery or search, and the music industry shut Napster down.  Second-generation P2P file sharing apps distributed peer discovery and search.  The courts held that technologies with substantial noninfringing uses could not be shut down for all users indiscriminately.  So the content industry publicly and ruthlessly sued individual users of file sharing applications.  In the end, companies like Apple and Amazon brokered deals for legal sales of media files in online stores, the combined seller-producer coalition promoted those stores, and users came to turn to them first.

But the game has been played many times.  Printing presses.  Sheet music.  Piano rolls.  Phonograph recorders.  Tape recorders.  Video cassette recorders.  On and on.

Looking back, we see that the game's politics follow a pattern, too:

- White:  Decries the law poorly implemented, overreaching, technically ignorant, anti-competitive, and corrupt.

- Black:  Counters that White wrongly short-shrifts, or even simply ignores, the policy thrust of the law, disrupting a settled compromise achieved through legitimate political process.

- White:  Pleads technical infeasibility, or accuses law of strangling an emerging technical advancement.

- Black:  Counters that White ducks responsibility for designing systems responsive to the thrust of the law, pointing to past examples of successful compromise systems.

Pattern:
1. Attempt the thing inside a big company.
2. Fail, in part due to big-company controls and standards.
3. Form a startup to do the thing.
4. Ignore the controls and standards.
5. Establish that the thing is profitable.
6. Acquire the company.
7. Negotiate with controllers and compliance officers from a position of strength.
