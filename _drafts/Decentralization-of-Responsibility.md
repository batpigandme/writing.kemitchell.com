title: Decentralization of Responsibility

"Decentralization kills bad law" is ahistorical. Decentralization can shake a status quo.  But in the end, competing interests seek stability, and decentralization leverage usually accrues to centralized enterprises willing and able to cut new, stable, coalition deals with preexisting interests. The end result is nearly always a new equilibrium within the established legal framework, not a gaping decentralization-shaped hole in public policy.

If decentralization matters to you because centralization runs counter to your values, the lesson of history is that you can't win by decentralization alone.  If you run headlong at the law, without regard for the balance of interests it represents, and design your systems antisocially, you may get lucky and earn big for creating a chance to redistribute wealth, but you're unlikely to work lasting structural change.  To decentralize systems and keep them that way, we have to understand what we challenge, and learn to build systems that take responsibility for providing better balances of interests, not merely destabilizing what came before.

# The Decentralization Game

The government enforces some laws, like drug laws, and leaves private parties to enforce others, like most of the Copyright Act.  The players are different, but the game is played mostly the same:

- White:  Implements the system as simply as possible, under one company's operational and legal control.  Proves the concept and delivers value, at least partially illicit.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes the company for breaking the law and flaunting public policy.  Forces the company to shut the system down.

- White:  Reimplements without unitary operational control,  decentralizing, distributing, federating, and standardizing functional aspects of the system.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes those developing, maintaining, facilitating, and popularizing the reimplemented system for helping others break the law and flaunt public policy.  Forces them to stop, or if that's not possible, burdens and constrains them.

- White:  Decentralizes, distributes, federates, and standardizes the way the system is made, maintained, and facilitated.  Or, if feasible, meets imposed burdens and constraints.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes _end users_ of the system for breaking the law and flaunting public policy.  Pursues them ruthlessly, to make public examples and frighten all the other users they can't afford to pursue.

- White & Black:  Negotiate a compromise, within the law.  Jointly herd users toward the compromise system, which is often easy, since the compromise system needn't complicate itself in operation or control to avoid getting shut down.

File sharing services and the entertainment industry played this game in my youth.  Websites posted music and video files online, but websites could be shut down with one fell legal stroke.  Napster distributed the burden of compiling and distributing content, but not peer discovery or search, and the music industry shut Napster down.  Second-generation P2P file sharing apps distributed peer discovery and search.  The courts held that technologies with substantial noninfringing uses could not be shut down for all users indiscriminately.  So the content industry publicly and ruthlessly sued individual users of file sharing applications.  In the end, companies like Apple brokered deals for legal sales of media files in online stores, the combined seller-producer coalition promoted those stores, and users came to turn to them first.

This game has been played many times.  Printing presses.  Sheet music.  Piano rolls.  Phonograph recorders.  Tape recorders.  Video cassette recorders.

We will play it several times more in my lifetime.  E-commerce.  Social networks. Payments.  And so on. Stakes will remain high.

# The Policy Game

Politics connect policy to law.  Looking back, we see that the decentralization game's politics follow a pattern, too:

- White:  Decries applicable law as poorly implemented, overreaching, technically ignorant, anti-competitive, and corrupt.

  > Copyright law is bad public policy that affects too much creative work, doesn't anticipate cheap copying via computer technology, serves big content companies, and got written largely at their behest.

- Black:  Counters that White wrongly short-shrifts, or outright ignores, the basic fairness and policy thrust of the law, disrupting a settled compromise achieved through established political process.

  > Copyright law ensures that artists, producers, and the companies that support them get compensated for their work.

- White:  Pleads technical infeasibility, and accuses law of strangling an emerging technical advancement.

  > Computer systems will only get better at making copies of media, and DRM is fundamentally flawed. Rigorously enforcing current copyright law only helps the content industry keep the market locked into physical-media distribution, when all the technology for distribution over the 'Net already exists.

- Black:  Counters that White ducks responsibility for designing systems responsive to public policy, pointing to past examples of successful compromise systems.

  > All the technology for _free_ distribution exists, but not infrastructure that helps artists get paid for the value they deliver. In the past, technology and service companies helped the music industry administer a massive system of royalty calculations and disbursements, which makes artists tons of money each year.

In rare cases, the leverage decentralization buys moves policy itself.  But in the run of games, the law adapts to the technology, as by court decision, rather than forcing a rewrite of the legal regime or a revision of underlying public policy.  Napster begat case law about secondary copyright liability, the limits of responsibility for providing others tools with which they could infringe.  But it didn't change the fundamental policy behind copyright law, or the basic written structure of the Copyright Act:

> To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.

When decentralization _does_ affect policy, the effect usually comes at the compromise stage.  White and Black enshrine their compromise in the law.  Under the Copyright Act, we see that in provisions like compulsory licensing: situations where owners of rights _have_ to license use of their work, but get paid an amount set by law.

Law changes this way, rather than bowing to new technology, because the people and interest groups invested in prior compromises, embedded in the law and the systems built up around it, don't disappear.  In fact, they're often far better at expressing themselves through the political process than upstart newcomers.  When decentralizers present themselves as a threat, as shock troops, it's that much easier to rally incumbents to a common cause.

Decentralization is fundamentally a question of _how_ we do what we want to do.  It affects only incidentally, or in edge cases, the question of whether what we want to do is just, or should be allowed.  In other words, decentralization means a change in implementation details. Decentralizers get cut out when they focus obsessively on decentralization, and forget the purpose and balances inherent in the process they're trying to decentralize.

# The Business Game

Manufacturing opportunities to redistribute wealth is good business.  So the rules of operational, legal, and political decentralization etched themselves into industry.

The enterprise opportunity of a network technology changes over time:  High in risk, with low probability of long-term reward, in the initial, centralized stage, before decentralization. Then low in risk and high in reward, in the similarly centralized but more competitive compromise stage.  A large business aims to catch the technical wave early enough to earn a seat at the compromise table, but not so early that the company, or its customers, catch Hell.

When an established company steps in too early, it puts its whole value and reputation at stake.  Risk management---compliance, accounting, legal, and so on---keeps would-be entrepreneurs on payroll from wagering the good corporate name to make their own.  Large companies therefore come late to iconoclastic decentralization drives, by conscious, institutional design.  When risk management functions normally, large companies lack the expertise and connections to hold themselves out as credible rescuers from the lawless, decentralized fray.  No iPod, no iTunes.

Of course, the middle, decentralized stages also run crosswise with enterprise-scale operations.  Their instincts to capture and protect business value tend to strangle opportunities based on loose confederation.  Their management hierarchies drive off risk-hungry helions who excel in chaos.  Enterprises are big structure, and they breed more big structure.  Destabilization is not their forte.

To fill this capability gap, enterprises use start-up companies, and to a lesser extent risk-shielded, autonomous subsidiaries and secret skunkworks projects, to pressure incumbents and capture released value.  Speculative ventures don't have public money or trust to safeguard, eschew risk management for focused, risky gambles, and attract the kind of Wild West personalities bred to claw to the tops of dogpiles.  But the endgame of most start-up companies is sale to an established concern with access to public capital.  Such concerns happily foot the financial bills---from founders, venture capitalists, and so on---for packaging up opportunity for sale.  In part because the value acquired by assimilating a start-up is different in kind from what enterprises can produce for themselves.  They can't _do_ destabilization, but they can buy it.

Acquisition begins a process of reconciliation.  From a public policy standpoint, start-up companies running headlong at settled markets operate antisocially, and often at the edge of legality.  Adherence to big-company risk management and work style comes as a calculated shock.  M&A typically features executive retention, but founders often depart as soon as they can.  Ideally, after they've done their part to help the acquirer broker a new, stable compromise with other stakeholders.

# Metagame

The decentralization game as we know it plays great for those served well by venture-backed multiples and entrenched public-company compromise cease-fires.  If that's you, skip the rest, and go get yourself a drink. The part describing how things _are_ and _have been_ is over, and it's all good news for you so far.

The decentralization game does _not_ play well for those who favor decentralization, variously defined, because decentralization favors values like end-user privacy and autonomy.  Whatever gains the decentralization game achieves for those values rolls back when systems recentralize.  Over the long view, decentralization serves just as a catalyst, destabilizing the status quo long enough to recrystalize wealth, control, and information in a slightly different lattice. Maybe that redistribution has value-positive secondary effects.  Very often the opposite.

A few thoughts. Call them opportunities.

## Minimize Collateral Damage

If you swing into an established market like a recking ball, you won't be first pick to put the pieces back together. The more collateral damage you inflict, the less qualified you seem as architect.  The less your preferences will affect the design of the new, stable system.

Minimize collateral damage by approaching the game as a negotiation, rather than a conquest.  Decentralizing some or all of an existing system, or even merely demonstrating that's possible, can earn you leverage.  Incumbents that otherwise wouldn't give you time of day may engage.  But in the end, you need a coalition and a new normal that most of the political will in the system can accept.  There will be winners and losers.  There always are.  But interest groups rarely just disappear.  A splash of decentralization won't melt anyone on contact, like the Wicked Witch of the West.

As in any negotiation, you want to study your starting point, prior deals, and prior cycles of decentralization. _Why_ is the system the way it is now?  Sometimes, the answer will be illegitimate: unexamined tradition, practical miscalculation, corruption, changed circumstances.  But one fault doesn't damn the whole structure.  Even if a system was perverse from conception, the test is whether it endured.  Identify as many interests affected as you can, and feel out how the status quo balances them, statically and dynamically.

It's damn difficult mapping out all the stakeholder constituencies in a complex system, especially when they've been quietly on ceasefire for some time, rather than loudly fighting in public.  But that is exactly the map you need to navigate for a new compromise.  Try not to piss off the people you need.  Take pains to show understanding and respect for their stake in the game.  Know their point of view well enough to anticipate when your actions come across as assault on their position.

## Avoid Tunnel Vision

Most decentralization activists that I know believe decentralization breeds universal benefits.  Privacy protects everyone.  Autonomy empowers everyone.  Resilience supports everyone.

How much?

Even if you think it's broken, mismanaged, corrupt, and stupid, if the stakes in the current system are high, that's probably because utility and reliance are, too.  If decentralization means trading off some of that existing utility, even temporarily---because your system is new and immature, because decentralization requires it technically---the benefit of decentralization has to offset that loss.  More than that, it has to be as compelling, visible, and well articulated as the lost utility it offsets.

In other words, don't assume anyone cares about your values, or your approach to serving them, as you do.  You will probably need some users who aren't allied in your values, to make your coalition.  You will probably need to make some new allies who are, more or less from scratch.

## Understand the Business Dynamic

Most decentralization efforts don't attract much attention at all. Those that do enjoy momentum both from allies motivated by shared values, and businesspeople who know the game. There's nothing inherently poisonous about the latter. Arguably, any new, more decentralized stable state will need some opportunists, to make a coalition.

All the usual cautions re speculation and other people's money remain in full effect. Beware of situations where you receive support or attention for one reason, and pretend it's for another, or decide you'd rather not know. Beware situations where one side "uses" the other, which "uses" it back, in turn. When you build a team, take investment, or share governance, do your due diligence.
