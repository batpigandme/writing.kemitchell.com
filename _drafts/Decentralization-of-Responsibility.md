title: Decentralization of Responsibility

Law is a kind of applied history.  "Decentralize the service to avoid the law" is ahistorical.

Some laws put the government in charge of enforcement, as with criminal law or defense.  Other laws rely on private parties to enforce, as with copyright and the CFAA.  In either case, the game plays out largely the same.

- White:  Implement the system as simply as possible, under one company's operational and legal control.

- Black:  Sue or prosecute the company for breaking the law and flaunting public policy.

- White:  Reimplement the system without unitary operational control.  Decentralize, distribute, federate, standardize, &c. its operation.

- Black:  Sue or prosecute those developing or maintaining the reimplemented system for helping others break the law and flaunt public policy.  Shut them down, or if that's not possible, burden and constrain them.

- White:  Decentralize, distribute, federate, &c. the way the system is made and maintained.  Or simply meet the burdens and constraints imposed by law, if possible.

- Black:  Sue or prosecute those using the system, for breaking the law and flaunting public policy.  Pursue them ruthlessly, and make public examples of them, to frighten other users, since you can't afford to sue all of them.

- White & Black:  Negotiate a compromise with Black.

File sharing developers and the entertainment industry played this game in my youth.  Websites posted music and video files online.  Compiling sufficient content, plus hosting, proved very expensive, and the sites could be shut down by one legal stroke.  Napster distributed compilation of content and distribution, bot not peer discovery or search.  The music industry shut Napster down.  Second-generation P2P file sharing apps distributed or federated peer discovery and search.  The courts held that technologies with substantial noninfringing uses could not be shut down for all users indiscriminately.  So the content industry publicly and ruthlessly sued individual users of file sharing applications.  In the end, companies like Apple and Amazon brokered deals for legal sales of media files.

Pattern:
1. Attempt the thing inside a big company.
2. Fail, in part due to big-company controls and standards.
3. Form a startup to do the thing.
4. Ignore the controls and standards.
5. Establish that the thing is profitable.
6. Acquire the company.
7. Negotiate with controllers and compliance officers from a position of strength.
