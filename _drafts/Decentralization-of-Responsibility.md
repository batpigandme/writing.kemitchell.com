"Decentralize around the law" is ahistorical. Decentralization can shake a status quo apart. But in the end, the system seeks a steady state, and decentralization leverage usually accrues to centralized enterprises willing and able to cut new, stable deals with enterprise-incumbents. The end result is nearly always a new equilibrium within the established legal framework, not a gaping decentralization-shaped hole in public policy.

If decentralization matters to you because decentralization matters to your values, the lesson of history is to get wise. If you run headlong at the law, without regard for the balance of interests it represents, and design your systems indifferently, your service as expendable shock troop for the new winners might be well compensated by those to whom wealth gets redistributed, but it will not tend to work lasting structural change. To build decentralized systems that stay both decentralized and relevant, we have to learn to build decentralized systems that address broader concerns, from creator compensation to tax to public safety, that come with fitting into the broader world.

## The Decentralization Game

The government enforces some laws, like criminal laws.  The government leaves private parties to enforce others, like most of the Copyright Act.  The players are different, but the game is played  mostly the same:

- White:  Implements the system as simply as possible, under one company's operational and legal control.  Proves the concept and delivers value, the latter at least partially illicit.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes the company for breaking the law and flaunting public policy.  Forces the company to shut the system down.

- White:  Reimplements without unitary operational control,  decentralizing, distributing, federating, and standardizing functional aspects of the system.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes those developing, maintaining, and facilitating the reimplemented system, for helping others break the law and flaunt public policy.  Forces them to stop, or if that's not possible, burdens and constrains them.

- White:  Decentralizes, distributes, federates, and standardizes the way the system is made, maintained, and facilitated.  Or, if feasible, meets imposed burdens and constraints.

- Black:  Sues or prosecutes end users of the system for breaking the law and flaunting public policy.  Pursues them ruthlessly, to make public examples, and frightens other users they can't afford to sue or prosecute en masse.

- White & Black:  Negotiate a compromise, within the law.  Jointly herd users toward the compromise system, which is often easy, since the compromise system needn't complicate itself in operation or control to avoid getting shut down.

File sharing services and the entertainment industry played this game in my youth.  Websites posted music and video files online, but websites could be shut down with one fell legal stroke.  Napster distributed the burden of compiling and distributing content, but not peer discovery or search, and the music industry shut Napster down.  Second-generation P2P file sharing apps distributed peer discovery and search.  The courts held that technologies with substantial noninfringing uses could not be shut down for all users indiscriminately.  So the content industry publicly and ruthlessly sued individual users of file sharing applications.  In the end, companies like Apple brokered deals for legal sales of media files in online stores, the combined seller-producer coalition promoted those stores, and users came to turn to them first.

But the game has been played many times.  Printing presses.  Sheet music.  Piano rolls.  Phonograph recorders.  Tape recorders.  Video cassette recorders.  We will play it again in my lifetime.  Likely several times.  For e-commerce.  For social networks. And so on.

## The Policy Game

Looking back, we see that the game's politics follow a pattern, too:

- White:  Decries applicable law as poorly implemented, overreaching, technically ignorant, anti-competitive, and corrupt.

- Black:  Counters that White wrongly short-shrifts, or outright ignores, the policy thrust of the law, disrupting a settled compromise achieved through established political process.

- White:  Pleads technical infeasibility, and accuses law of strangling an emerging technical advancement.

- Black:  Counters that White ducks responsibility for designing systems responsive to the thrust of the law, pointing to past examples of successful compromise systems.

In rare cases, the leverage decentralization buys moves policy.  But in the run of games, the law adapts to the technology, as by court decision, rather than forcing a rewrite of the legal regime or a revision of underlying public policy.  Napster begat case law about secondary copyright liability, the limits of responsibility for providing others tools with which they could infringe.  But it didn't change the fundamental policy behind copyright law, or the basic written structure of the Copyright Act.

That's because the people and interest groups invested in the prior compromise, embedded in the law and the systems built up around it, don't disappear.  In fact, their interests are often far better expressed through the policy-making process than newcomers'.  Creative artists still need protection to secure compensation for their work.  Companies set up to consolidate and administer artists' financial interests don't turn tail at first sign of compelling new technology.

## The Business Game

Good tech is good business, or at a minimum some chance to redistribute wealth.  So the rules of operational, legal, and political decentralization have etched themselves into business as we know it.

The enterprise opportunity of a network technology changes over time:  high in risk, with low probability of long-term reward, in the initial, centralized stage, before decentralization, then lower in risk and high in reward, in the similarly centralized but more competitive compromise stage.  A large business aims to catch the technical wave early enough to earn a seat at the compromise table, but not so early that the company, or its customers, catch Hell for flaunting the law.

When a company steps in too early, it puts its whole value and reputation at stake.  That's often far more to risk than to gain.  Risk management---as compliance, accounting, legal, or business strategy---erects internal controls to keep would-be entrepreneurs on payroll from wagering the good corporate name to make their own.  But when a company steps in too late, when risk is low, it lacks the expertise and connections to hold itself out as a credible candidate for compromise counterparty.  No iPod, no iTunes.

Of course, the middle, decentralized stages poorly match large enterprises' working methods.  Their instincts to capture and protect business value tend to strangle opportunities based on loose confederation.  Their management hierarchies and scale stifle risk-hungry helions who excel in those conditions.

To bridge this gap, enterprises use start-up companies, and to a lesser extent risk-shielded, autonomous subsidiaries and secret skunkworks projects, to pressure incumbents.  Speculative ventures don't have public money to safeguard, eschew risk management for focused, risky gambles, and attract the kind of Wild West personalities capable of fighting to the top of a dogpile.  But the endgame of most start-up companies is sale to an established enterprise with access to public capital.  Such enterprises are more than happy to foot the bill for the financiers---founders, venture capitalists, and so on---who kept the dog in the fight.  In part because the value acquired by assimilating a start-up is different in kind from what enterprise can make for themselves.

Acquisition begins a process of reconciliation.  From a public policy standpoint, start-up companies running headlong at settled legal compromises operate antisocially.  Adherence to big-company risk management and work style comes as a calculated shock, like a kind of reform school.  M&A typically features executive retention, but founders often depart as soon as they can.  Ideally, after they've been thoroughly tapped to broker a compromise with other stakeholders,  where they now enjoy the resources and clout of their acquirer.

## Metagame

This system works for those who benefit by venture-backed multiples and entrenched public-company compromise cease-fires.  It does not work for those who favor "decentralization", variously defined, because decentralization favors values like user privacy or autonomy.  The endgame is centralized, if competitive, services.  Decentralization is but a catalyst, destabilizing the status quo long enough to recrystalize wealth and control in a different pattern among established interests. Decentralization is a means to wealth redistribution, but not a structural end in itself.

Centralized enterprises offer a compliant, socially conscious alternative to decentralizers run amok. Incumbents broker deals with staid enterprises as an appealing alternative.
