How do we learn so many slogans so fast?  I'll never know.  I suppose one or another speaks to each of us, individually.

The one that gets me is "No Justice, No Peace".

Justice is my department, try as I might to wriggle away from that uncomfortable fact.  It's easy to say that "justice" means "criminal justice", that criminal justice means criminal lawyers, and that I am not a criminal lawyer.  I've never once appeared in court, even civil court, and pride myself on keeping clients out of there.  But that's just a dodge.  In essence: "Not my department."

Justice personified carries scales in one hand and a sword in the other.  She wears a blindfold in between.  The blindfold does not stop the left hand, the law, from seeing what the right hand, the police, is doing.  The sword is stained with blood.  The blood is all one color, but it comes from some kinds of people more than others.  Enough that we have to call the blindfold into question.

The scales, quite frankly, aren't level.  They don't sit quite straight.  Different penalties for drugs of one community versus another.  Lack of independent prosecution for police misconduct, compounded by immunity.  Ineffectual political and practical equality.  Liability to legalism and other means to game clearly motivated rules, from labor contracts to generations of innovations in restrictive covenants and college admissions.  In so many cases where the sword has fallen, the scales have tilted to one side.

For people who aren't lawyers, there are people who can participate in the legal system and there is everyone else.  They don't slice and dice the legal profession into specialties, like lawyers do.  When a problem affects the legal system, it's a lawyer problem.  Nobody else is allowed to fix it, so lawyers have to fix it.

In the Roman conception, Justice did not stand alone.  She was often accompanied, even preceded, by her sister goddess, Prudence.  The iconography of American law has exalted the image of Justice, and largely forgotten Prudence.  Which is a shame.  A truly painful metaphor, given current events.

Prudence was not just a Virtue, but the Mother of All Virtues.  It was Prudence that distinguished courage from foolishness, caution from cowardice, and answered other, harder moral questions of extent.  In one hand, she carried a serpent, symbol of worldly troubles.  In the other hand, her tool, a mirror.  Prudence wasn't blind.  She could see the world's troubles, the serpent, quite clearly.  Through the mirror, she could see also herself.
