title: No Justice

How do we learn so many slogans so fast?  I'll never know.  I suppose one or another speaks to each of us, individually.

Mine is "No Justice, No Peace".

Justice is my department, try as I might to wriggle away from it.  It's easy to say that "justice" means "criminal justice", that I am not a criminal lawyer.  In essence: "Not my department."
