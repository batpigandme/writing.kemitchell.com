How do we learn so many slogans so fast?  I'll never know.  I suppose one or another speaks to each of us, individually.

"No Justice, No Peace" is mine.

I'm a lawyer.  Justice is my department, try as I might to wriggle away from that uncomfortable fact.  It's easy to say that "justice" means "criminal justice", that criminal justice means criminal lawyers, that I am not a criminal lawyer, which is true.  I've never once appeared in court, even civil court.  I pride myself on keeping clients out of the place.  But today, that's just a dodge.  In essence: "Not my department."  But it is.  My power flows from that system.  As do my duties.

Justice personified carries scales in one hand and a sword in the other.  She wears a blindfold in between.  But the blindfold does not stop the right hand from knowing what the left hand is doing.  As lawyers, we know better than most what the police do.  The sword is stained with blood.  The blood is all one color, but it comes from some colors of people more often than others.  Enough to call the blindfold into deep question.

The scales, quite frankly, aren't level.  They don't sit quite straight.  Different penalties for drugs of one community versus another.  Lack of independent prosecution for police misconduct, compounded by immunity.  Ineffectual political and practical equality.  Liability to legalism and other means to game moral rules, from mandatory minimums to racial covenants.  In so many cases where the sword has fallen, the scales have tilted to one side, lending force of body to the blow.

For people who aren't lawyers, there are people who can participate in the system and there is everyone else.  They don't slice and dice the legal profession into specialties, like lawyers do.  Nor should they.  When a problem affects the legal system, it's a lawyer problem.  Nobody else is allowed to fix it, so lawyers have to do.  After all, we have denied the public standing to serve themselves.  We have afforded ourselves a subculture they do not know.

In the Roman conception, Justice did not stand alone.  She was oft accompanied, even preceded, by her elder sister, Prudence.  The iconography of American law has exalted the image of Justice, and largely forgotten Prudence.  Which is a shame and a moral liability.  And a truly painful symptom at the root of current events now come to light.

Prudence was not just a Virtue, but the Mother of All Virtues.  It was Prudence, not Justice, that distinguished courage from foolishness, caution from cowardice.  It was Prudence that answered the hard moral questions of extent.

In one hand, she carried a serpent, symbol of all worldly trouble.  In the other hand, her tool, a mirror.  Prudence wasn't blind.  She could see the serpent quite clearly.  Through the mirror, she could see also herself.

In times of trouble, blindness is often convenient.  A mirror, rarely so.  Have we the prudence to stare into the mirror?
