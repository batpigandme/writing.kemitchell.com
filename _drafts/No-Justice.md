How do we learn so many slogans so fast?  I'll never know.  I suppose one or another speaks to each of us most, individually.

The one that gets me is "No Justice, No Peace".

Justice is my department, try as I might to wriggle away from it.  It's easy to say that "justice" means "criminal justice", that I am not a criminal lawyer.  In essence: "Not my department."  But that's just a dodge.

For people who aren't lawyers, there are people who can participate in the legal system, the lawyers, and is everyone else.  They don't slice and dice the profession into specialties, like lawyers do.  When a problem affects the legal system, it's a lawyer problem.  Nobody else is allowed to fix it.
