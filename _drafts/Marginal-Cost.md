> Information Wants To Be Free.  Information also wants to be expensive. Information wants to be free because it has become so cheap to distribute, copy, and recombine---too cheap to meter. It wants to be expensive because it can be immeasurably valuable to the recipient. That tension will not go away. It leads to endless wrenching debate about price, copyright, 'intellectual property', the moral rightness of casual distribution, because each round of new devices makes the tension worse, not better.

<!-- Marginal cost is not the only cost. -->

<!-- Nobody has infinite time. -->

<!-- Cost-benefit analysis always applies. -->

<!-- Cost of the acquisition process can overshadow price paid. -->

<!-- Other information professions defy this logic. -->

<!-- This is a double-edged sword from any programmer. -->
