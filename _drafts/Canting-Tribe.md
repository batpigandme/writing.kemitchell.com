What do we _do_ about pointless, inefficient variation in basic business contracts?  What do we _do_ once we've felt smart for calling out obvious inefficiency, and realize we're still stuck with the problem?  What are we going to _do_ about hours wasted, reviewing the same old kind of contract again and again, or waiting for review, only to hear that, yes, it was exactly what we thought it was?

Here is an answer: Join the [Canting Tribe](https://cantingtribe.com), an open, voluntary, Internet-enabled network for legal form standardization.  Its first project is [The Canting Tribe NDA](https://nda.cantingtribe.com), a bog standard, mutual nondisclosure agreement for general business use, specifically designed to create network effects that stop waste.

## Building a Standard-Form Network

Many good lawyers have published boring MNDAs for free.  The Canting Tribe NDA is another one.  It differs not in how it solves the "we need terms for sharing confidential information" problem, but in how it attacks the problem of having to read and reread terms that solve that problem, over and over and over again.  It's dead focused on one, primary, critical goal:

> Bootstrap a network of a companies that propose, accept, and spread word of the Canting Tribe NDA, to maximize in-network, no-review-needed NDA transactions.

The Canting Tribe's tools for network building are few, simple, and complimentary:

1.  Revisions of the Canting Tribe NDA are rigorously versioned.  Version 1.0.0 has been published.  _Version 1.0.0 will never change_.  Improvements will come with new, unique version numbers.

2.  Copies of the Canting Tribe NDA come with an additional signature page, from the side proposing the terms.  The one proposing signs that page to fill in key blanks in the form, but also as a kind of certificate, guaranteeing that the terms proposed exactly match those of the official Canting Tribe NDA published with the version number on <https://nda.cantingtribe.com>.

3.  Companies that review and approve the Canting Tribe NDA can add their names to a growing register of users that appears on <https://nda.cantingtribe.com>.  That register has the network-promoting effect of reassuring those receiving proposals to sign the Canting Tribe NDA for the first time, by presenting social proof on the website mentioned on the certificate.

These mechanism form the smallest, simplest positive-feedback loop for adoption I could manage.  Rigorous versioning makes it possible for companies to join the register, and for certificates to guarantee authenticity.  Certificates and the register allows new companies to review and rely on the terms.  Reliance demonstrates the benefit of joining the network.  Demonstrated benefit leads more companies to join the register.  The more companies review, rely, and join the register, the larger the network grows.  The larger the network grows, the more opportunities it creates to sign mutual nondisclosure agreements without waiting for review.

## Cockroach Dragon

But why _yet another_ NDA cure?  _That is exactly why_.  The nondisclosure agreement is [the cockroach of contracts](http://www.adamsdrafting.com/abuse-of-nondisclosure-agreements/) that will not die.  It is the dragon at the mouth of the cave of deals-law optimizations.  No other kind of agreement causes so much frustration with the state of routine business law practice.  No other kind of agreement begs so loudly for a better way.  No other kind of agreement has left the bones and armor of would-be reformers strewn about its lair.  I have fought the same fight with different weapons, and lost.

Those of us who care about legal productivity _have_ to attack the NDA problem, and keep attacking it.  Slaying that dread beast of inefficiency is the best available proof that business law can overcome obvious coordination challenges, and the surest path to a bit of redemption for an ill-reputed profession.

If the Canting Tribe NDA succeeds, there will be more Canting Tribe forms.  And there will be a new model, without the sloth, overhead, and specialization of existing, industry-group efforts.  Success will come easier, after the first.

## What to Do

I'll be reaching out to friends, colleagues, and clients about using the Canting Tribe NDA and joining the register of adopting companies.  If you want to do something about the problem, do the same.

[Instructions for registering are here](https://nda.cantingtribe.com/#listing).  [Questions and answers are here](https://nda.cantingtribe.com/#questions).  The e-mail address for feedback on the form is <comments@cantingtribe.com>.

## Business

I am pursuing this project through RxNDA, the LLC I formed for <https://rxnda.com>, a prior attempt at NDA standardization focusing on technical features and online convenience.

For now, I won't be charging anything related to Canting Tribe or the Canting Tribe NDA.  In the future, if the project succeeds, I may charge for maintaining listings for large companies on the register, to cover time and expenses, and to fund further professional review, revision, and commentary on the terms of the form itself.

## About the Name

"Canting Tribe" comes from the name of [a famous 17th-century dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Dictionary_of_the_Terms_Ancient_and_Modern_of_the_Canting_Crew) of [thieves' cant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thieves%27_cant) and slang.

A name like "Canting Tribe NDA" can _mean_ a specific set of standardized terms within a community.  Any dealmaker that learns, uses, and recognizes that vocabulary joins the community.  By learning a shared language, companies can learn to talk the basic phrases of business legal, fast.
