Josh Simmons, president of the Open Source Initiative, recently [wrote](https://opensource.org/node/1068):

> Even on the topic of licensing, OSI has been found on its back foot.  Our response to the recent flare ups of open core and source available licensing was lackluster.  Everyone agrees: open source needs a bolder, more responsive, and representative OSI.

Do you agree that the Open Source Initiative ought to be bolder?  I don't, and I am not alone.  Josh and other members of the OSI board know it.  They have heard it from me directly.

Josh and his fellow directors are no fools.  Quite the opposite.  And they are no liars, either.  Every one that I have met or spoken to personally has struck me as intelligent, conscientious, and earnestly motivated.  Totally in line with their deservedly good reputations.

And yet, I have no doubt that Josh's statement will pass with approval in their company.  That his statement of noncontroversy will itself seem noncontroversial, somehow, within the OSI bubble.

How can this be?

It's not about lapse of intellectual honesty on any individual basis.  We have seen this blinkered, insular perspective reflected in print, time and time again.  The question we ought to be asking is how the structure of the Open Source Initiative as an institution, the experience of running for election, winning, adding the line to your resume, and attending the meetings, constantly renders good people experienced in often factious online collaboration incapable of registering and acknowledging meaningful dissent.  In collective terms, why has the Open Source Initiative preferred to practice the degenerate form of "consensus building" that builds consensus by excluding more and more of those who don't agree, rather than opening itself more broadly?  Why does every humbling moment prompt a hollow reassertion of nonexistent authority?

The simple fact is that folks making open source software today don't need any Open Source Initiative.  Practitioners haven't yearned for any centralized, hierarchical pinnacle of the movement as a whole, and I doubt very many want to subordinate themselves to any such structure now.  After all, they have obsoleted that model.  Spontaneous projects and user groups acting autonomously are just more resilient and productive than that.

The OSI accomplished a media campaign.  As a side effect, the phrase "open source" rose in collective hacker consciousness.  For-profit firms like GitHub leveraged that vocabulary to grow, spreading and changing its meaning and mindshare in turn.  If, as Josh wrote, the OSI as we know it did not exist until 2013, then the OSI we know today had no part of the initial, meaningful contribution.  It didn't lend the name to the movement.  It merely tries to inherit from the organization that did.

Many of the folks on the OSI board, now and in the past, have risen up through participation and leadership in different projects and user groups.  In that way, each board has been, in its own way, a very impressive collection of broadly aligned talent.  But why the devil would such talented people divert time and attention from the actual work of open source to a corporation?

I feel no motivation to follow them.
