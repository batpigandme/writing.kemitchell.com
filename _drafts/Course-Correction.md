Josh Simmons, president of the Open Source Initiative, recently [wrote](https://opensource.org/node/1068):

> Even on the topic of licensing, OSI has been found on its back foot.  Our response to the recent flare ups of open core and source available licensing was lackluster.  Everyone agrees: open source needs a bolder, more responsive, and representative OSI.

Do you agree that the Open Source Initiative ought to be bolder?  That it's up to the Open Source Initiative to respond to changes in open source?  That the Open Source Initiative ought to represent open source as a whole?  I don't, and I am not alone.  Josh and other members of the board know it.  They have heard it from me directly.

Josh and his fellow directors are no fools, and they are no liars, either.  Every one that I have met or spoken to personally has struck me as intelligent, conscientious, and earnestly motivated.  Totally in line with deservedly good reputations.

And yet, I have no doubt that Josh's statement will pass with approval, perhaps even without comment, in their company.  His assertion of no controversy will itself seem noncontroversial, somehow, under the OSI bubble.

How can these things all be true at once?

It's not about lapse of intellectual honesty on any individual basis.  We have seen this blinkered, insular presumptuousness time and time again.  The question we ought to be asking is how the structure of the Open Source Initiative as an institution, the experience of running for election, winning, adding the line to your resume, and attending the meetings, constantly renders good people incapable of registering or acknowledging mounting dissent.  In collective terms, why has the Open Source Initiative preferred to practice "consensus building" mostly by excluding and denying more people who disagree?  Why does every humbling moment prompt a hollow reassertion of nonexistent authority?

The simple fact is that people using and making open source don't need any Open Source Initiative.  Users can recognize five popular licenses and Google the rest.  Participants, as a rule, never yearned for any centralized, hierarchical pinnacle of the movement, and I doubt very many want to subordinate themselves to any such structure now.  After all, open source has leapfrogged and explicitly avoided that model.  Spontaneous projects and user groups acting autonomously have proven more resilient, productive, and welcoming to new talent than board meetings.  Something called an "Open Source Initiative" might do some good, but not due to any lingering magic in that name, and not from on high.  From below.

Once upon a time, the OSI coordinated a bottom-up media campaign.  As a consequence, the phrase "open source" rose in collective consciousness.  For-profit firms like GitHub leveraged that vocabulary to grow, spreading its mindshare and further evolving its meaning.  If, as Josh wrote, the OSI as we know it now did not exist until 2013, then the OSI we know today had no part in the marketing coup, the only meaningfully systemic contribution under the banner to date.  The OSI we know today didn't give "open source" to the movement.  It inherited the name "Open Source Initiative" from those who did.  And that is still giving the organization, rather than the individuals and for-profit companies around it, too much credit.

Many of the folks on the OSI board, now and in the past, have risen up through participation in different open source projects, user groups, and companies.  In that way, each board has been its own impressive collection of broadly aligned talent, drawn from a deep common pool.  But why the devil would such talented people, raised in open source, decide to divert their time and energy into board meetings for an organization that does not, at its core, facilitate software projects?  Ask developers who know what the Open Source Initiative _is_ what the Open Source Initiative _does_, apart from licensing.

I can't speak for anyone else.  But I can ask myself: Why would I run for the board of the Open Source Initiative?

The first and most obvious answer is that winning would be a nice ego boost.  Open source still has cachet, still has an impact, and it would certainly stoke my piety to be recognized as a high cleric of the faith

The grander the church, the more impressive the priesthood.  And vice versa: high priest of low cult is not so much fun.  As a member of the OSI board, the last thing I'd want to do, for my ego's sake, is to admit that OSI and open source aren't identical, that OSI isn't what I thought it was, doesn't function effectively, and doesn't hold any deep wisdom, peculiar ability, or authority.  If OSI were a sham, that would make me director of a sham, which is not particularly ingratiating.

The second clear motive is career.  Adding "OSI Director" to my resume could help me win new opportunities, especially from big companies.

Big companies have the most money.  And also a lot of people reading resumes who don't come from open source, but from business management.  Exactly the kinds of people prone to mistakenly accept suggestions that some hierarchical organization is "at the top" of open source.

Within a company, it doesn't get higher than the board.  If you want to hire an open source person, director seems the highest rank.  Even if you rightly gather that the Open Source Initiative as an institution doesn't have any special powers or esoteric knowledge, if the election process is competitive enough, you just lean on it as a proxy.  Pointing out how few open source people actually care about OSI, and how few members of the open source "community" are also paying members of the Open Source Initiative, deadens that effect.

Finally, I could see myself gunning for a board seat if I, or more likely a company or client, had some specific, programmatic interest to stump for within OSI's Calvinball bureaucracy.  My company might see open source as a kind of branding asset, a credential differentiating its business like "OSI Director" differentiates board members, and seek to deny OSI blessing for use of that phrase by competitors.  My company might see open source as a source of raw material or tribute, and seek to stymie new licenses that don't honor our economic march-in right.  My company might have a meta project or other policy initiative, and seek to secure OSI's imprimatur for it, to render it apparently neutral or established on first glance.  I might join the board to dissolve the license-review process, which would serve License Zero and adopters of licenses I help write.

Private agendas often conflict.  But over time, going to OSI for this or for that steers the organization toward a broad, hodgepodge scope, more decisive, authoritative action, and a bigger organization, overall.  The number of things companies would like OSI to do to their competitors is practically limitless.  Lobbying to have them done is tax-free.

But there are limits on unbounded growth, and Josh has had to mention one of them: money.

> The bad news is that we only have 5 months operating budget in reserve, thus lack the funding to hire additional staff... And we're likely to suffer a 20-40% drop in revenue due to the pandemic and resulting economic downturn.

Josh asks for more than just cash, calling new voices to speak out about their needs.  But characteristically, all the ways that OSI wants to listen involve submission to its own process and self-image.  Want a civil conversation about OSI's direction?  Social media, IRC, or mailing lists.  Want to vote and stay on top of new work?  Become a member, add to the headcount, and pay $40.  Want to affiliate your similarly situated organization?  That's a commitment to [stump for OSI publicly when they ask, work through its delegate system, and pony up ... "where possible"](https://opensource.org/affiliates/about#commitment).  And of course there's [corporate sponsorship](https://opensource.org/files/SponsorProspectus.pdf), replete with marketing benefits galore.

Every nonprofit asks for money.  No begrudging that.  For org insiders, there's a constant balancing act to perform, pitching the broadest feasible program that outsiders might fund, growing the organization, and hewing to what donors actually want, and their generosity will bear.

It's not strange to see orgs crying "What should we do?" and also "Give us money to do more things!" at the same time.  But that framing leaves no room for what be the most common right answer: do one thing, be clear about what that is, and do it well.
