Josh Simmons, president of the Open Source Initiative, recently [wrote](https://opensource.org/node/1068):

> Even on the topic of licensing, OSI has been found on its back foot.  Our response to the recent flare ups of open core and source available licensing was lackluster.  Everyone agrees: open source needs a bolder, more responsive, and representative OSI.

Do you agree that the Open Source Initiative ought to be bolder?  I don't, and I am not alone.  Josh and other members of the OSI board know it.  They have heard it from me directly.

Josh and his fellow directors are no fools.  Quite the opposite.  And they are no liars, either.  Every one that I have met or spoken to personally has struck me as intelligent, conscientious, and earnestly motivated.  Totally in line with deservedly good reputations.

And yet, I have no doubt that Josh's statement will pass with approval, perhaps even without comment, in their company.  That his statement of noncontroversy will itself seem noncontroversial, somehow, within the OSI bubble.

How can this be?

It's not about lapse of intellectual honesty on any individual basis.  We have seen this blinkered, insular perspective reflected, time and time again.  It's a pattern.  The question we ought to be asking is how the structure of the Open Source Initiative as an institution, the experience of running for election, winning, adding the line to your resume, and attending the meetings, constantly renders good people experienced in often factious online collaboration incapable of registering and acknowledging meaningful dissent.  In collective terms, why has the Open Source Initiative preferred to practice the degenerate form of "consensus building" that builds consensus by excluding or simply denying the existence of more and more people who don't agree, rather than opening itself more broadly?  Why does every humbling moment prompt a hollow reassertion of nonexistent authority?

The simple fact is that folks making open source software today don't need any Open Source Initiative.  Practitioners haven't yearned for any centralized, hierarchical pinnacle of the movement as a whole, and I doubt very many want to subordinate themselves to any such structure now.  After all, they have obsoleted that model.  Spontaneous projects and user groups acting autonomously are just more resilient and productive than that.  Something called an "Open Source Initiative" might do some good, but not from above.  From below, like everyone else.

The OSI coordinated a media campaign.  As a side effect, the phrase "open source" rose in collective consciousness.  For-profit firms like GitHub leveraged that vocabulary to grow, spreading and changing its mindshare and meaning in turn.  If, as Josh wrote, the OSI as we know it did not exist until 2013, then the OSI we know today had no part of the institution's only meaningful contribution.  The OSI we know today didn't lend the name "open source" to the movement.  It merely inherits the name "Open Source Initiative" from the now extinct organization that did.

Many of the folks on the OSI board, now and in the past, have risen up through participation and leadership in different open source projects and user groups.  In that way, each board has been, in its own way, a very impressive collection of broadly aligned talent, drawn from a common pool.  But why the devil would such talented people divert time and attention from the actual work of open source to a corporation?

I can't speak for anyone else.  But I can ask myself: Why would I run for the board of the Open Source Initiative?

The first and most obvious answer is that it would be tremendously flattering.  Open source still has cachet, still has an impact, and it would stoke piety to feel recognized as a higher cleric of that faith.

The more authoritative the church, the more impressive the priesthood.  And vice versa.  As a member of the OSI board, the last thing I'd want to do, for my ego's sake, is admit that the OSI isn't what I thought it was, doesn't function effectively, and doesn't hold any deep wisdom, peculiar ability, or recognized authority in or about open source.  If the OSI were a sham, I would be a sham, too, sitting on its board.

The second clear motive is career.  Adding "OSI Director" to my resume could help me win new opportunities, especially from big companies.

Big companies have the most money.  And also a lot of people reading resumes who don't come from open source and mistakenly accept suggestions that some hierarchical organization is in charge of it.  Within a company, it doesn't get higher than the board.  If you want to hire an open source person, you can't pick higher off the tree than a board member.  Even if you presume the Open Source Initiative doesn't do or know anything special, if the election process is competitive enough, you might mistake that for social proof, as well.  Pointing out how few open source people actually care about OSI, and how few members of the open source "community" are also paying members of the Open Source Initiative, wouldn't help.

Finally, I could see myself gunning for a board seat if I, or more likely my company or client, had some specific, programmatic interest to stump for within OSI's processes.  My company might see open source as a kind of branding asset, a credential differentiating our business like "OSI Director" differentiates individual hires, and seek to deny OSI blessing for use of that phrase by competitors.  My company might see open source as a source of raw material or tribute, and seek to stymie new licenses that don't honor our economic march-in right.  Red Hat and Amazon come to mind.  I might join the board to dissolve the license-review process, which would serve License Zero and adopters of licenses I help write.

Private agendas can conflict with each other.  But over time, they push toward a broader scope, more decisive, authoritative action, and a bigger organization, overall.  The number of things companies would like OSI to do to their competitors is practically limitless.  Investments lobbying for them are tax-deductible.

But there are limits on unbounded growth, the Josh has had to mention one of them: money.

> The bad news is that we only have 5 months operating budget in reserve, thus lack the funding to hire additional staff... And we're likely to suffer a 20-40% drop in revenue due to the pandemic and resulting economic downturn.

Josh admirably asks for more than just cash, asking for voices to speak out with their needs.  But characteristically, all the ways that OSI wants to hear involve submission to its own process.  Want a civil conversation about OSI's direction?  Social media, IRC, or mailing lists.  Want to vote and stay on top of new work, become a paying member at $40 a pop.  Want to affiliate your organization?  That's a commitment to [stump for OSI publicly, work through its delegate system, and pony up "where possible"](https://opensource.org/affiliates/about#commitment).  And of course there's [corporate sponsorship](https://opensource.org/files/SponsorProspectus.pdf), replete with comarketing commitments.
