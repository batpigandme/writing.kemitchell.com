Part of being wealthy is having more than the next bastard.  But when others aren't just less well off, but poor, poverty limits how wealthy wealth can be.

Part of being smart is knowing more than the next bastard.  But when others aren't just less knowledgeable, but ignorant, ignorance limits how smart smarts can be.

Part of being healthy is being stronger than the next bastard.  But when others aren't just less well, but sick, sickness limits how strong the healthy can be. 

Simplifying a bit, those of greater means can contend in two basic ways.  They can lift up the poor so the problems of poverty no longer limit quality of life.  Or they can separate themselves from the poor and poverty problems.  They can invest in raising the ceiling or take the money and run.

We all know rich neighborhoods and poor neighborhoods, rich school districts and poor school districts, rich states and poor states, rich countries and poor countries.  We can drive five minutes through an unfamiliar place and gather more or less where it stands.  Sometimes the signs are intentionally obvious.  This neighborhood has a gate.  That _house_ has a gate.  That restaurant, club, event, or store is "exclusive", by which we mean mostly expensive.

Who would pay that much for a sandwich?  Not necessarily the people eating them.  But for a sandwich _and_ a guarantee of separation, a reassurance against encroachment by others and their problems?  It comes as a package.  Meanwhile, in miniature, some of us will buy a $10 burrito, rather than a $5 burrito, in part because we prefer $10 burrito shops and the company of $10 people.  My go-to spot plays more Jerry Garcia than Chente Fern√°ndez.  Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.

In the end, there's no seceding from the human race.  Certain classes of very real problems---communicable disease included---cut indifferently across the walls we build to separate incidents of wealth and incidents of poverty.  We don't need a virus to see this.

We are likely at home.  The junkies of Market Street are still shooting up on Market Street.  They have to.  The campers of Oakland are still shivering, from the vans of west side to the camps deep east.  It's chilly outside.

You can live in the hills.  You can live in a penthouse.  You can drive or be driven every which way, all week long.  You can't entirely escape what's going on around you.  You live in San Francisco or Oakland or your tiny town of 500.  Other people live there, too.

That isn't to say the burden of hardship falls equally.  It doesn't.  As we have seen, not just COVID-19, but also reactions to and mitigations of COVID-19, fall harder on the poor than on the wealthy.  But they will take some toll from nearly everyone, and not just in dollars.

We are all losing time, opportunity, and experience.  Few of us are doing what we'd hoped and planned, rich or poor.  Some of us are dying, with or without the virus, or that virus in particular.

Fewer of us would be in trouble if more had the means, the opportunity, and the education to hear the calls from our public health professionals, understand them, and follow them.

No matter how much we have to call our own---money, education, health, reputation---we cherish it in large part because we assume we'll get to use, boast, or share it in the circumstances we've known.  A hundred bucks is a hundred bucks.  But what a hundred bucks means or does comes down to context.  It's not just inflation, a question of how much.  It's also availability, a question of what's available and possible.  It\'s a question of others, their capability, their availability, their willingness.

In the end, it's the experience of earning, winning, having, or spending a hundred bucks that attracts us.  There's nothing intrinsically valuable in life _but_ experience.  It's life for life's sake, all the way down.  Exclude, separate, bunker up and hunker down.  Do it effectively enough, and you're just alone.  If the wealth of unsettled land is enough for you, alone, you can go back to nature.  But that's not what most have learned to want from life.

Investing in others---giving back, if you prefer---plays by the same rules.
