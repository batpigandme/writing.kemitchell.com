Part of being wealthy is having more than the next bastard.  But when others aren't just less well off, but poor, poverty limits how wealthy wealth can be.

Part of being smart is knowing more than the next bastard.  But when others aren't just less knowledgeable, but ignorant, ignorance limits how how smart smarts can do.

Part of being healthy is being stronger than the next bastard.  But when others aren't just less well, but sick, sickness limits the health of all.

Those of greater wealth, greater smarts, and greater health can contend with these realities in two basic ways.  They can lift up those less endowed so the problems of poverty, ignorance, and sickness no longer limit quality of life for all.  Or they can separate themselves from the poor and their problems.  They can take the money and run.  To a point.

We all know rich neighborhoods and poor neighborhoods, rich school districts and poor school districts, rich states and poor states, rich countries and poor countries.  Driving five minutes through an unfamiliar place, we gather more or less where it stands.  Many signs are subtle.  Neglected buildings speak poverty, for example.  But some signs are built.  This neighborhood has a gate.  That _house_ has a gate.  That restaurant, club, event, or store is "exclusive", by which we mean prohibitively expensive.  We can tell without reading the menu.

Who would pay $100+ for a sandwich?  Not necessarily the people eating them.  But for a sandwich _and_ a guarantee of separation, a reassurance of continue quarantine against an unwelcome class of infectious problems?  It comes as a package.  And it goes all the way down.  Some of us will buy a $10 burrito, when a $5 burrito will do, in part because we prefer $10 shops and the company of $10 people.  My go-to spot plays more Jerry Garcia than Chente Fern√°ndez.  Mea maxima culpa.

But in the end, there's no seceding from the human race.  Certain classes of very real problems---communicable disease included---cut indifferently across the walls we build to separate the incidents of wealth and the incidents of poverty.  We don't need a virus to see this.  The same lesson has been available to us, daily, in any number of dimensions, our whole lives.

We are likely at home.  The junkies of Market Street are still scrounging, still shooting up.  They have to.  The campers of Oakland are still shivering, from the vans of west side to the camps deep east.  It's chilly outside.  The battered spouse, the lonely elder, the abused child, are trapped at home in a new and serious way.  There's no longer anywhere else for them to go.

Perhaps we can't see these people, from our couches, indoors.  But we know they're there, can imagine them, if we try.  The knowledge and experience that help us do so are far more personal, more intuitive, and more broadly shared than any of the information about the virus spooking us now.  We need experts to understand viruses.  We can't see viruses.  We have never lived as viruses.

As we should all expect, not just COVID-19, but also reactions to and mitigations of COVID-19, fall harder on the poor than on the wealthy.  But they will take some toll from nearly everyone, and not just in dollars.  You can rent a nice apartment, as I do.  You can live in the hills.  You buy yourself a penthouse.  You can drive or be driven every which way, all week long.  You can't quite escape what's going on around you.  We are all losing time, opportunity, and experience.  Few of us are doing what we'd hoped and planned, rich or poor.  Some of us are dying, with or without any virus, or that virus in particular.

Fewer of us would be in trouble if more had the means, the ability, the opportunity, and the education to hear the calls from our public health professionals, understand them, and follow them.  Many rich people, in one of the richest countries of the world, are confronting this reality now, and discovering there's no buying out of it.  We can mitigate some impacts better than others.  But we cannot contain them.  We're advantaged, not exempt.

No matter how much we have to call our own---money, education, health, reputation---we cherish it in large part because we assume the circumstances we've grown to know and expect will continue.  A hundred bucks is a hundred bucks, as long as things keep going as they've been going.  But what a hundred bucks means can change, quickly.  It's not just inflation, a question of how much.  It's also availability, a question of what's available.  It\'s a question of others, their capability, their availability, their willingness.  If you wanted to buy front-row seats to a concert, you're out of luck now.  If you were looking forward to a vacation, you're not anymore.  There are things that cannot be bought, people that cannot be hired, things that cannot be done.  Or the premium prices for doing so make the $100 sandwich look cheap.

In the end, it's the experience of earning, winning, having, or spending a hundred bucks that attracts us.  There's nothing inherently magical about dollars, and nothing intrinsically valuable in life _but_ experience.  Exclude, separate, bunker up and hunker down---do it all effectively enough, and you're mostly just alone.  If the wealth of unsettled land is enough for you, all by your lonesome, you can go back to nature.  But that's not what most of us have learned to want from life.

Investing in others---giving back, if you prefer---plays by the same rules.  It's an experience, else we wouldn't do it.  Experiences vary.  It is one thing to send a few dollars to a cause.  Net effect: a fleeting moment of satisfaction, a few less dollars, not much in the way of experience.  It's quite another to give in kind, to take responsibility for a problem, to get well and truly involved, to acknowledge and even look forward to the personal benefits of becoming mixed up in things, as a necessary motivation for staying that way.

It feels a bit harder to get involved in things now, restrictions being what they are.  But there are a million ways, waiting.  Go looking for them.  Be ready to be found by them.  If this is not a needy time for you, it could be a helping time.

I recommend helping.  Emphatically.
