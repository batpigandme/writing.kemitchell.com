title: Programmer Supremacy
description: prying open the trap of "software freedom"
---

Nathan Schneider's [recent post on the ethical software movement](https://hackcur.io/organize-for-change-or-quit-your-job/) reminded me of an old quip about open source from Andrew Ross, quoted in E. Gabriella Coleman's _Coding Freedom_ back in 2006: "voices proclaiming freedom in every direction, but justice in none".

That stung when I first read it, several years ago.  It stings, if anything, more deeply now.  Because it's not just that free and open source people do a lot of _talking_ about freedom, and very little about justice.  It's that even when free and open source people talk about freedom, they don't really mean freedom. They mean power, and specifically their own power, the power of programmers as a self-conscious class.

Try, if you can, to pretend you never heard the phrase "software freedom". Or replace it in your mind with some arbitrary codeword, like "Macaroni". Now pretend you work for a dictionary company, as a lexicographer, and it's time to put "Macaroni" in the files.

Where do people use the term? Why do they use it? What do they appear to mean by it, not according to their own definitions, but according to how it's used, in practice? Your job isn't to report what some community says that it means, but what they mean when they say it.

Overwhelmingly, "software freedom" gets used whenever programmers hear the word "no" about their programming. Want to use that framework for a project at work? If the answer is "you can't", for whatever reason, that's an infringement of "software freedom". Bought a new gadget from the store, and can't turn off a feature you don't like?  If the source code isn't available, there's no "software freedom" there. Can't use that library to run a website without sharing all the code for it?  Another "software freedom" violation, even if giving potential competitors the same privilege was never part of the plan.

Programmers invoke software freedom to say that they ought to be allowed, even praised, for doing what they wanna do, other people's considerations be damned. The phrase "software freedom" helps them to say this without actually saying so, because saying it so directly would sound clearly selfish, immature, and absurd. Thus laid bare, software freedom boils down to a kind of avocational supremacy. The usual rules about permission, compensation, respect, and so on don't apply, insofar as they'd apply to someone making software. Software people get an exception because they make software. Software people reign supreme.

This hasn't been hard to see, unless seeing it conflicted with your ego or interests. The Bible of hackerdom, [Stephen Levy's _Hackers_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution), calls it out very specifically:

> In a perfect hacker world, anyone pissed off enough to open up a control box near a traffic light and take it apart to make it work better should be perfectly welcome to make the attempt. Rules that prevent you from taking matters like that into your own hands are too ridiculous to even consider abiding by. This attitude helped the Model Railroad Club start, on an extremely informal basis, something called the Midnight Requisitioning Committee. When TMRC needed a set of diodes or some extra relays to build some new feature into The System, a few S&P people would wait until dark and find their way into the places where those things were kept. None of the hackers, who were as a rule scrupulously honest in other matters, seemed to equate this with "stealing." A willful blindness.

The hacker "ethic" is characterized more than anything by its willingness to look the other way from, or even to preempt and dismiss, investigation into the consequences of hacker prerogative over others getting trampled. If a license, a business model, or a law prohibits what the hacker wants, it's "ridiculous", illegitimate, inconceivable, void. No inquiry is made into the motives or circumstances behind it.

In the most intuitive case, the fact that the maker of a product, service, or program needs to recoup costs or earn fair compensation becomes simply irrelevant. When such realities get acknowledged at all, the answer is most often a hypothetical, futuristic, highly non-specific Utopian get-out-of-moral-quandry-free card. A "post-scarcity" economy. A level playing field on which to pillage the market for your own account.  Universal basic income.  And so on.  Meanwhile, the other side of the supposed equation gets what they want _now_.

In the end, the surest test of "software freedom" versus "programmer supremacy", universal principle versus self-justification, is transitivity. Software freedom fails the transitivity test.  Those insisting on the benefits of "software freedom" for themselves rarely or never insist on those same benefits for others, especially others unlike them.

True, Stallman and his school stressed "users". But they thought of themselves as users, and set users' wants equal to their own. After all, everyone should want to be a programmer, and inevitably would be.  The loop of chauvinism closes: ... and those foolish enough not to can't be helped.  Software is speech and those who cannot read and write will be sorted out by history.  At least until the question is whether software, including APIs, can or ought to be encumbered by intellectual property, in which case they're all about function, more Skilsaw than Shakespeare.

Other schools have also paid rhetorical due to the emancipation of society more broadly. But only in vague hypotheticals, visions of imminent or distant promised future. Often these promises take a borderline millenarian, emancipation-in-the-promised-land tone.  Thus, when free and open source finally come to full moral fruition, hackers will stop drawing the line of freedom at their own front doors, or around the headquarters' of their employers, and Freedom (or Openness) will sweep the land like a mighty wave.  It is only a matter of time.  Never mind that the bounty of today is earned largely by standing on the thin green line Utopian communalism on the supply side, among programmers, and the harsh, fish-gobble-fish demand side of the market.

This wave of inevitable freedom, incidentally, would be welcome not just outside of programming but also within it. For as we've seen, injustice afflicts not just helpless muggles but also a great many very helpful developers. Namely: those who refuse to take jobs working for, or selling into, large firms that gobble up freedom for their tools, libraries, and frameworks, in order to make and keep leverage over those they charge and monetize.
