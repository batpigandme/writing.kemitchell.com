_Part of a series, [Unsustainability at Scale](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/10/15/Unsustainability-at-Scale.html)_

It's Thursday afternoon.  An employee at a large company opens a pull request on the company's preferred open source framework.  It takes six hours of maintainer time to amend and merge, over two weeknights and the weekend.  The pull request adds a feature of immediate use only to the company, which hires a consultancy to roll it out.  The consultancy bills eight hours.  Meanwhile, the employee spends 20% Friday on their own, unfinished framework.

Andy and Marie are Internet friends.  They hack on 3D rendering software together.  Andy has a new job at a design studio doing interactive work, but Marie's still starving for her art.  Andy uses one of Marie's libraries on a work project, and sends her a request to support another file format.  She writes the patch, but in no particular hurry.  Andy misses the client deadline.

A startup selling network surveillance infrastructure to repressive national governments needs a deployment-orchestration tool.  Fortunately, they find a promising, MIT-licensed tool online.  The tool embodies a year's worth of full-time engineer work.  The lead maintainer sports an EFF sticker on her laptop during her latest recorded conference talk.  She ends with a plea for financial support; she made the conference on her own time and dime.

At a local meetup, Dennis takes a turn at the mic, explaining that he's having trouble finding a paid start in programming, and would appreciate mentorship.  Back by the pizza, he gets the same advice twice:  Contribute to open source.  Dennis misses the next meetup, searching "help wanted" issues instead.  An application turns up an interview, but he doesn't get past the code challenge.  The challenge seemed like real work, but they didn't offer any pay for his time on it.

What's going on here?  Is open source malfunctioning?  If not open source, what's gone wrong?

These kinds of things happen all the time.  If someone in a similar situation triggers your next GitHub notification, will you recognize them?  How?

We're flying blind.  The platform we've flocked to hides the context needed to recognize and avoid these failures.  With even less of the overall picture than I've sketched in vignette above, we just don't know any better.  We may have the moral equipment to do right, but we're rarely reminded to use it.

[I have been @kemitchell since February 18, 2010.](https://api.github.com/users/kemitchell)  During that time, I've marched under many flags---of clients, employers, universities, and foundations---sometimes a few at a time.  But [@kemitchell](https://github.com/kemitchell) I have been, and shall remain.  Not k.e.mitchell@someco.com last week.  Not @otherco/kyle next week.

Frankly, it couldn't really _work_ any other way.  No more than Twitter could work if every move, job change, or relationship induced a start from scratch, a new account, a new handle, mass pleas to update address books.  Identity that's constant in the social-network way---a consequence of being fluid in all these other dimensions---makes it possible for me to identify on a visceral level with what "@kemitchell" means on some public appliance called github.com.  Identify in a way I never could with, say, a work e-mail address, or even an @gmail.com.

Folks use GitHub accounts for work all the time.  And when we run into others, we'd be right to ask:  Are they appearing here as a hobbyist?  At work for a company?  For some paying client?  Their @handle doesn't say.  Compared to many popular, public-Internet identity systems of the past, that's a glaring omission.

Glaring in that frame, but otherwise, apparently pretty irrelevant.  Sometimes folks bring it up.  But mostly, we just don't.  We don't feel it necessary.  The appliance, its interface, and its model of identity all discourage such feelings.  There's lower friction that way.  Achievement and reputation are more portable that way.

When I deal with people who know me---personally, professionally, or even exclusively as @kemitchell---they identify @kemitchell with their experience.  They may even project their feelings about @kemitchell onto my affiliations.  If I'm not so bad, perhaps whoever I'm working for couldn't be so bad, either.  I do the same with others.

In that way, I'd like to think GitHub brought some of the transitive, mercenary rapport characteristic of independents---coders, designers, writers, and independent professionals---to the world of the traditionally employed.  That it drew some of the [W-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_W-2) masses closer to a midpoint between lifer and freelancer.

Freelance is how I got a start in software, and I'm biased.  But the improvement I see isn't nudging people closer to a romanticized, unbeholden Zen of [1099](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_1099).  Standing in the middle, and transitioning from one extreme toward another, demonstrates the continuum between, reveals choices made for you all the way to either side.

GitHub's implementation of social-network identity gives everyone on the platform a bit of the lived experience of the hired-gun coder, but not necessarily any of the education, moral or practical, that comes with it.  The vignettes at the top of this post offend the sense of propriety, the set of conscientious instincts, that I learned as a contractor, fluttering between clients:

> Give as you take.
>
> Talk frankly about time and money.
>
> Slice the pie fairly.
>
> Keep your integrity at all costs.
>
> Pay help forward to new people.
>
> Honest pay for honest work.

These are classic solutions to basic collective action problems, passed down by repeat players and reproduced by lived experience.  Reliable fruits of enlightened self-interest.  Rules you do your part to enforce, by reputation and occasionally sanction.  Universal moral principles in specialized application to situations involving money.  Maxims you observe in dealings with your fiercest competitors, because nobody wants to be market leader in a smoldering moral wasteland.

The primary source of online identity for many of us has rocketed from the relative context-richness of something like kyle@someco.com, which calls attention to business and business propriety, even when it _shouldn't_ matter, to the context-freedom of something like @kemitchell, which doesn't hint any affiliation or pecuniary interest, even when it _should_.  The longest-experienced, most reflective old-timer can make abhorrent, greenhorn- or even sociopath-worthy mistakes with blinders on.  And those blinders make it damn hard to spot any actual sociopaths, drawn to a social margin they can squeeze like wraiths to the One Ring.

Meanwhile, a whole new generation is coming up.  They're on GitHub well before their first jobs.  They shouldn't confuse the default in their time for a natural order.  There have always been choices to make in how we identify ourselves, and how we identify and interact with others.  There have always been moral dimensions to those choices.  There always will be, no matter what the defaults happen to be.

So be mindful:

- The way identity works on GitHub helps us forget about business and other affiliations.  Sometimes we should.  Sometimes we shouldn't.

- Social media platforms like GitHub invite us to substitute thoughts and feelings about those we know for thoughts, feelings, and uncertainty we'd otherwise have about a system chock full of strangers.  Sometimes that's saintly.  Sometimes it's blind.

- Stripping context away from interactions and exchanges stops us remembering all the expectations we've developed, based on subtle hints and background.  Some of that's baggage.  Some of it's wisdom.

When we interact people-to-people on GitHub, and money finds its way into the context, say on a pull request for a feature we need at work, we face a choice.  One we might prefer to ignore, depending on what we call comfortable.  Assume both sides know, somehow, that the context has gone from buddy-buddy to hobby on one side and business on the other.  GitHub doesn't help us recognize this---that's the first problem.  Does our behavior change?

No.  Largely, it does not.

Where I see exceptions, it's usually easy to spot the entrepreneur- or freelance-shaped developer.  In other words, developers familiar and comfortable with business, developers capable of recognizing a business situation and taking it in stride, even as an opportunity.  Can I pay you to land this faster?  You're already working on the project; want to do that full time?  How can I establish that I respect you, and that you'll get a fair shake next time I come calling, and you answer?

On the flip side, students, hobbyists, and employees sufficiently insulated from "the business end of business" tend to say nothing at all about money or any other kind of exchange on or about GitHub, ever.  Why would they?  They feel no malfunction, no _wrongness_, when a pull request costs a maintainer a nice chunk of life.  If another pull request takes a dozen hours of an employee-colleague's time on the private repo, what's the difference?  Those they know are trying to learn, or toying around, or on salary.  The network encourages us to project that reality on the network as a whole.

In informal, non-business situations, which even the businessiest of businesspeople preserve in their private lives, we trust these imbalances to work themselves out over time.  Or we accept that any aggregate loss probably gets offset by something we can't or don't bother counting.  I close your PR.  Later on, you'll close one of mine.  Or one of my friend's, whose time I sopped up on a bug.  Nobody really wants to count up, value, and settle all these scores, only to end up near enough to zeroes all the way 'round that no one cares.  So why bother keeping score?

Stepping back, we all know the asymmetries that make all zeroes unlikely.  We know that open source thrives on radical imbalance between developer effort going in and user benefit going out, that even "free" use creates incrementally more demand on maintainers.  We know that when buddy-buddy becomes buddy-business, it benefits business to make on like buddy-buddy as long as it can.  And we know that the budget incentives and financial controls of business structure encourage getting away with that as long and as often as possible.

We know, in short, that we could probably count up the gives and takes for all of our friends on GitHub, and end up near zeroes as far as we go.  But there are massive accounts out there drawn deeply in the negative.  The debits corresponding to those credits amount to no less for being spread across the personal accounts of volunteers.  Volunteers who couldn't have been worked legally, as interns, for nothing, but will receive nothing all the same.  Volunteers who would never describe other kinds of work directly benefiting for-profit firms as "volunteering".
