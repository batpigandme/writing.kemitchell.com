_Part of a series, [Unsustainability at Scale](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/10/15/Unsustainability-at-Scale.html)_

It's Thursday afternoon.  An employee at a large company opens a pull request on the company's open source framework of choice.  It takes six hours of maintainer time to amend and merge, over two weeknights and the weekend.  The pull request adds a feature of immediate use only to the company, which hires a consultancy to roll it out.  The consultancy bills eight hours.  Meanwhile, the employee spends 20% Friday on their own, unfinished framework.

Andy and Marie are Internet friends.  They hack on 3D rendering software together.  Andy has a new job at a design studio doing interactive work, but Marie's still starving for her art.  Andy uses one of Marie's libraries on a work project, and sends her a request to support another file format.  Marie assumes another Andy side project.  She writes the patch, but in no particular hurry.  Andy misses the client deadline.

A startup selling network surveillance infrastructure to repressive national governments needs deployment orchestration.  Fortunately, they find a promising, MIT-licensed tool online.  The tool embodies a year's worth of full-time engineer work.  The lead contributor sports an EFF sticker on her laptop during her latest recorded conference talk.  She ends with a plea for financial support; she made the conference on her own time and dime.

At a local meetup, Dennis takes a turn at the mic, explaining that he's having trouble finding a paid start in programming, and would appreciate mentorship.  Back by the pizza, he gets the same advice twice:  contribute to open source.  Dennis misses the next meetup, searching "help wanted" issues instead.  An application turns up an interview, but he doesn't get past the code challenge.  The challenge seemed like real work, but they didn't offer any pay for his time on it.  The candidate with the longest GitHub streak gets the job.

What's going on here?  Is open source malfunctioning?  If not open source, what's gone wrong?

These kinds of things happen all the time.  If someone in a similar situation triggers your next GitHub notification, will you recognize them?  How?

We're flying blind.  The platform we've flocked to hides the context needed to recognize and avoid these wrongs.  With even less of the overall picture than I've sketched in vignette above, we just don't know any better.  We may have the moral equipment to do right, but we rarely see opportunities to use it.

[I have been @kemitchell since February 18, 2010.](https://api.github.com/users/kemitchell)  During that time, I've marched under many flags---of clients, employers, universities, and foundations---sometimes a few at a time.  But [@kemitchell](https://github.com/kemitchell) I have been, and shall remain.  Not k.e.mitchell@someco.com last week.  Not @otherco/kyle next week.

Frankly, it couldn't really _work_ any other way.  No more than Twitter could work if every move, job change, or relationship induced a start from scratch, a new account, a new handle, mass pleas to update address books.  Identity that's constant in the social-network way---a consequence of being fluid in all these other dimensions---makes it possible for me to identify on a visceral level with what "@kemitchell" means on some public appliance called github.com.  Identify in a way I never could with, say, a work e-mail address, or even an @gmail.com.

Folks use GitHub accounts for work all the time.  And when we collaborate with others, we'd be right to ask:  Is this hobby stuff?  Is this for work at a company?  For some paying client?  Your @handle doesn't say.  Compared to many popular, public-Internet identity systems of the past, that's a glaring omission.

Glaring in that frame, but otherwise, apparently pretty uninteresting.  Sometimes folks bring it up.  But mostly, we just don't.  We don't feel it necessary.  The appliance, its interface, and its model of identity all discourage such feelings.  There's lower friction that way.  Achievement and reputation are more portable that way.

When I deal with people who know me---personally, professionally, or even exclusively as @kemitchell---they identify @kemitchell with their experience.  They may even project their feelings about @kemitchell onto my affiliations, if they happen to know them.  If @kemitchell's not so bad, perhaps whoever he's willing to work for couldn't be so bad, either.  I do the same with others.

In that way, I'd like to think GitHub brought some of the transitive, mercenary rapport characteristic of independents---coders, designers, writers, and independent professionals---to the world of the traditionally employed.  That it draws some of the [W-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_W-2) masses closer to a midpoint between lifer and freelancer.

Freelance is how I got my start, and I'm positively biased.  But the improvement I see isn't nudging people closer to a romanticized, unbeholden Zen of [1099](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_1099).  Standing in the middle, and transitioning from one extreme toward another, demonstrates the continuum between, reveals choices made and to be made.  GitHub could do identity any number of ways.  We as a community can layer any number of norms and conventions on top.

GitHub's implementation of social-network identity gives everyone on the platform a bit of the lived experience of the hired-gun coder, but not necessarily any of the education, moral or practical, that comes with it.  The vignettes at the top of this post offend the sense of propriety, the set of conscientious instincts, that I learned as a contractor, fluttering between clients.  To wit:

> Give as you take.
>
> Talk frankly about time and money.
>
> Slice the pie fairly.
>
> Keep your integrity at all costs.
>
> Pay help forward to new people.
>
> Honest pay for honest work.

These are classic solutions to basic collective action problems, passed down by repeat players and reproduced by many a hard-headed new hand.  Universal moral principles in specialized application to situations involving money.  Rules you do your part to enforce, by reputation and occasionally sanction.  Maxims you observe in dealings with your fiercest competitors, because nobody wants to be market leader in a scorched interpersonal wasteland.

The primary mode of online identity for many of us has rocketed from the relative context-richness of something like kyle@someco.com, which calls attention to business and business expectations, even when it _shouldn't_ matter, to the context-freedom of something like @kemitchell, which doesn't hint any affiliation or pecuniary interest, even when it _should_.  The longest-experienced, most reflective old-timer can make abhorrent mistakes with blinders on.  And those blinders make it damn hard to spot any actual sociopaths, drawn to any margin they can squeeze like wraiths to the One Ring.

Meanwhile, a whole new generation is coming up.  They're on GitHub well before their first jobs.

They shouldn't confuse the default in their time for a natural order.  There have always been choices to make in how we identify ourselves, and how we identify and interact with others.  There have always been moral dimensions to those choices.  There always will be, no matter what defaults tools and software happen to set.

Laying it out just as plainly as I can:

- The way identity works on GitHub helps us forget about business and other affiliations.  Sometimes we should.  Sometimes we shouldn't.  That's on us.

- GitHub invites us to fill in thoughts and feelings about a system mostly chock full of strangers with thoughts and feelings about the few of those people we know.  Sometimes that's saintly.  Sometimes it's blind.

- Stripping context away from interactions and exchanges stops us reliably applying precepts born of experience in higher-bandwidth encounters, based on subtle hints and context that gets stripped away.  Some of those norms are baggage.  Some of them are very wise, and more alive and well in small business than megacorporations.  GitHub doesn't teach the difference.

When we interact people-to-people on GitHub, and money finds its way into the mix, say on a pull request for a feature we need at work, we face a choice.  One we might prefer to ignore.  Assume both sides know, somehow, that the context has gone from pleasure to business.  GitHub doesn't help much there, and that's the first problem.  But taking it for granted, do we adjust our behavior to reflect?

No.  Largely, we do not.

Where I see exceptions, it's usually pretty easy to spot the developers with meaningful entrepreneur or freelance experience.  In other words, developers comfortable with business, and capable of taking the switch in stride, as an opportunity.  Can I put time on something else to free you up for this?  Can I pay you to land this faster?  You're already working on the project; want to do that full time?  How can I establish that I respect you, and that you'll get a fair shake each time I come calling, and you answer?

On the flip side, students, hobbyists, and employees sufficiently insulated from "the business end of business" tend to say nothing at all about money or any other kind of exchange on GitHub, ever.  Why would they?  Those they know are trying to learn, or toying around, or on salary.  Time is never lost.  Experience and dopamine are only gained.  The network encourages us to project the context we know onto everyone we encounter.

In informal, non-business situations, which even the businessiest of businesspeople preserve in their private lives, we trust these imbalances to work themselves out over time.  Or we accept that any aggregate loss probably gets offset by something we can't or don't bother counting.  I close your PR.  Later on, you'll close one of mine.  Or one of my friend's, whose time I sopped up on a bug.  Nobody really wants to count up, value, and settle all these scores, only to end up near enough to zeroes all the way 'round.  So why bother keeping score?

Stepping back, we all know the asymmetries that make zeroes unlikely.  We know that open source thrives on radical imbalance between developer effort going in and user benefit going out, that even "free" use creates incrementally more demand on maintainers.  We know that when buddy-buddy becomes buddy-business, it benefits business to make on like buddy-buddy if it can, that budgets, incentives, and financial controls encourage doing so as long and as often as possible.  We know that compensation in kind really only adds up if you are also a business, and running the kind of proprietary, one-way model that's produces comparable yield.

We know, in short, that we could probably count up the gives and takes for all of our friends' hobby work on GitHub, and end up near zeroes as far as we go.  But there are other accounts out there drawn deeply in the negative.  The credits offsetting those debits don't count for less being spread across many volunteers.  Volunteers who couldn't have been worked legally, and ethically, even as interns, for nothing.  Volunteers who would never describe other work directly benefiting for-profit firms with the v-word.

Other social networks have weathered major storms of controversy about sponsored content, product placements, and other ways business snuck by in stealth.  Conscientious users settled on norms of disclosure to fill the void.  Conscientious platforms built disclosure right into the interface, into policy.  In part because regulators came around asking questions.

GitHub is for making as well as consuming, and much of what gets made there is free to consume.  But how we spend our own time and others', how we work, should be no less informed than how we choose to spend our wages.  There are other areas where tools and platforms have fallen down in communicating affiliation, such as in licensing.  But none of those mechanisms is as crucial as how we work together.

We could get more good done, and do less wrong, by transparently acknowledging which hat we wear when asking and giving work on open source software.  We should accept the momentary awkwardness, an awkwardness that will pass in time, in posing questions about others' affiliations and support.  Bringing that information out into the open, we'll be able to make better choices.  Choices that affect individuals.  And choices that affect our code.
