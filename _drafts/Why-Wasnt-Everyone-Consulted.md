Write [a new open software license](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0.html)?  Prepare yourself for process criticism.  Even if it's a great license.

Launch a new [sustainability as a service offering](https://communitybridge.org/)?  Expect much the same.

> The launch of this platform, as proprietary software, without coordination with the rest of the FOSS organization community, is unnecessarily uncollaborative with our community and we therefore encourage some skepticism here.

In open software, some folks want to see everything done by a particular kind of committee, from the get-go.  I see and acknowledge the consistency of their criticism of other processes, including my own.  I recognize the hard work they've done to [make their preferences explicit and accessible](https://github.com/richardfontana/hbr/blob/master/HBR.md).  I recognize the refrain of [Why wasn't I consulted?](https://youtu.be/m0rakUuPXFM?t=746)

But I don't agree with it.

I reject it outright.

Committee work product has a well developed reputation, and not for clarity, approachability, or innovation.  Committee process leads to inferior results, or no results at all, with grim predictability.  Moreover, it's utterly incongruous with lessons from the software side of open software production.  The distinctions between legal tools and software tools that justify a difference in how we make legal tools are largely of lawyers' own making, and ought to be abolished.

## Spontaneous

Plenty of great open software begins as the work of a single developer or small group, working in private or pushing to a source repository nobody else knows about.  Their software eventually feeds into the mainstream of open software consumption, be it GitHub, npm, or another package repository, without outside collaboration, conscious governance, or approval.  It scratches the itch of those involved, that is both the point and all the necessary bona fides.

Only popularity distinguishes great software made this way from throwaway experiments made likewise.  The end results are distributed just the same, but a great deal more often, to a great deal more people.

Plenty of great open software ends just as it began, too: artifact of a specific need in a specific place at a specific time, when a bolt of inspiration struck.  But that is not the end of collaboration, even if the original crew never collaborates again.

No approval was required to make the start, and under the right license terms, no approval is required to continue from it, either.  [Substack](http://substack.net/) begat [Optimist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/optimist), and Optimist was good.  But, lo, the latest Optimist came out five years ago.  But from Optimist [Ben Coe](https://github.com/bcoe) and friends begat [Yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs), which was also very good, and keeps getting better.  Yargs' latest version came out a few days ago.

## Permission-Free

If we didn't know better, "permissionless" would sound like a bad thing.  Not having permission is generally less preferably to having it.  But the point is rather that we don't _need_ permission at all.  Not needing permission is the real rallying cry of software developers and innovation boosters.

As Git revolutionized revision control by making branches cheap, npm and similar distribution systems revolutionized distribution by making forks cheap.  To quote Isaac Schleuter: "There's plenty of room in the registry."  I've published [340 npm packages](https://npmjs.com/~kemitchell), and most of them are utter garbage.  A few of them are useful.  GitHub, npm, and friends welcome the chaff for the sake of the wheat.  That much wheat doesn't grow any other way.

Prior restraint, more speech
