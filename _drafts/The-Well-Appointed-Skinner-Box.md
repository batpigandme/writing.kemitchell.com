A few weeks ago, I decided to give [Medium](https://medium.com), the blog host meets social network, a try.  I cross-posted pieces from this blog there, and used Medium exclusively for [License Zero](https://licensezero.com), my latest project, which has involved a lot of writing.

I won't be posting to Medium any more, though I'll be keeping my account there, and perhaps commenting and responding to those who stay.  I'll be moving the blog for License Zero to its own site, like this one.

My experience on Medium has been mostly good.

It's nice to write there.  I've found my share of bugs in the editor, but I know how hard it is to write an editor.  I appreciate what they've accomplished.

In a design sense, Medium is a very nice Internet place.  From the type to the generous whitespace, it's an oddly humanitarian hideaway in an otherwise ad-laden traffic jam of visual and intellectual battering rams.

Long-form social networks are more or less the only ones I appreciate these days, and Medium certainly is that.  I particularly like treating comments to others' "stories" as stories in themselves.  Very nice.

Alas, there's just enough social media in what would otherwise be a very pleasant blog host to ruin it for me.  Batched notifications.  Accumulating "claps".  Readership statistics and reporting.  Ranking for exposure.  Pressure to include graphics, and apply other cringe worthy, eyeball-drawing tactics.  All the usual intended and unintended gamifications that drag the heart, soul, and daily experience of the thing back down into the social-media much of the way things go right now.

I wrote for many years on this blog without any such feedback.  I haven't permitted so much as Google Analytics here, and for good reason.

That isn't to say I haven't received feedback.  I've had heaps of it, in higher quality and lower quality.  The overwhelming majority has been good, especially when it was critical, and I'm not sure it would have been so critical in public.
