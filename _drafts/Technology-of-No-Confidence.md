California has sexy-cool, Baudrillard-would-dig-it lingo for
everything.  It wasn't until I moved here, and to Oakland in
particular, that I heard the term "direct action" in casual
conversation. It took me a while to figure out, since there's not
exactly a well-edited dictionary of East Bay organizer-speak to buy.
And, let's be honest, you don't just ask.

As usual, because I'm from Texas, once I finally got it, I also
got to bite my tongue a while.  Though my East Bay friends would
(will---Howdy, y'all!) take umbrage, the empowered, self-determining
buzz "direct action" talk induces is a perfect analog to the high my
Texas gun-nut, prepper, "[sheepdog]" friends are plinking diligently
on their weekends to maintain.

Texas has bad-ass, "Where'd 'ya get that stogie, Sarge?" abbreviations
for everything.  Like the [Army].  Fortunately, talking and dressing
up like the Army---you know, [tactical]---is a lot more fun than
boot camp and mortal combat on Tatooine while America buys bullshit
at the mall.  Or, you know, [going outside] in Texas.  No matter.
When SHTF---Shift Hits the Fan---and even our Bible-belt, HOA hamlet
ends up WROL---Without Rule of Law---our scientifically honed
EDC---Every Day Carry---will get us home to our elegantly packed
BOBs---Bug-Out Bags---stuffed with MREs---Meals Ready to Eat---so we
can GOOD---Get Out of Dodge---and ... something, somewhere.

Guns are a peculiar issue; you won't find an argument for equivalent
Best Coast fascination here.  Guns' inherent danger separates them
from other objects of a political---or highly politicized---nature.
It's intuitively wrong to class them with sit-ins, road blockades,
even uninvited-hoodlums-in-hoodies-broke-some-windows "riots", and
of course marijuana.  Cut-strength surrogates, like knives and other
matte-black-and-angry miscellany promise less killing power, but feed
the same power-and-agency fantasies as antidote to world-gone-mad
anxiety.  This scrawny, cannon-fodder-grade specimen your humble author
carries a pocket knife for apples and books-by-mail, and even _that_
grandpa-whittles-nothing-caliber toothpick gets a bit of the Walter
Mitty treatment now and then.

But even wallowing in absurdity that deep, all of these implements
naturally belong in a class of their own.  Violence is violence
is serious business.  "Voting from the rooftops" isn't paperwork,
even if one highly trained "operator" with an "auto" selector that
works isn't worth jack squat against any regime sane enough to pick
one-on-one fights.  We're all in a database now.

But apart from the inevitable collateral damage of guns doing as
they're designed, but not necessarily as their owners intended upon
[blissful union of man and machine][tractor], there is a practical
danger in the drug-like shot of synthetic, fantasy-amplified confidence
that comes with a firearm, especially a concealed firearm.  Even if a
gun never does bodily harm, as most legal guns don't, given [how many]
the industry has sold, there is a reliable, probably universal, nigh
on psychosomatic effect of having a gun at one's disposal.  If you're
scared of violent forces beyond your control and redemption from
corruption, be they "big government", mounting hordes of other-people,
or rival thugs, imagination-boosted visions of deftly deploying the
piece neatly counterbalance the imagination's otherwise unchecked
tendency to amplify nightmares.  As dark as your imagination can make
your nightmares, it can make the decisiveness of your gun.

For all but the longest-practiced, indifferently familiar gun users,
most legitimate professionals, it is devilishly hard to "drive the
gun" sober, in the sense of seeing it realistically.  A deep well
of culture conspires to make any gun talismanic.  I do believe that
some people can overcome that Cro-Magnon superstition, but I've
also seen evidence those folk are not well represented among gun
nuts, and in many cases little interested in guns---and therefore
"sheep"---full stop.  In any event, I'm not one of them, as I failed
to understand for far too long.  So no more guns for me.

Why go cold-turkey if the fantasy wasn't hurting anyone?  Why deal
with the withdrawal---like feeling "naked" without a wallet or
keys, with a sprinkle of Imminent Death.  Because as overinflated
as my nightmare-scenarios were and became, there was some kernel
of truth in them.  Violence and crime _are_.  They have happened to
me and to others I know and love.  Our governments---local, state,
and federal---do terrible things, much in need of tending and reform.

The power high that comes from a gun as power object masks both the
extent to which these concerns are grounded, and the extent to which
they're not.  At worst, it's overkill, a massive dose of palliative,
symptom-killing, but dependence-inducing treatment that makes the
underlying disorder undiagnosable, like laudanum for a toothache.
At best, it's a highly convincing placebo.

The margin of error manifests in many ways.  By outward appearance,
it's retrenchment, bunkering, survivalism.  Rather than meet your
neighbors---in the neighborhood or in that "other" part of town---you
cultivate contingency plans to repulse their attacks on your cache of
canned goods.  Rather than vote, you stockpile ammo for a revolution
whose results would prove inevitably worse than what any combination
of candidates on offer could muster.

Consciously or otherwise, you _secede_ politically.  To the extent
you believe in any kind of civic duty, you _abdicate_ the application
of reason to that duty.  Should the worst somehow come to pass---and
it hasn't, for quite some time---you will be historically vindicated,
and also substantially to blame.  As you might be for any individual
behavior that you know, if repeated en masse by your peers, would
hasten an avoidable tragedy.

As remarked very often by the nonviolence set, there's a natural
human bias toward seeing violence as unavoidable.  What begins as
posturing naturally escalates, unchecked by restraint and practice,
to a tussle on whatever weapons come to hand.  Even if you don't
buy that _every_ confrontation yields a nonviolent solution---I have
seen counterexamples I won't soon forget---you can conclude that the
moral error rate of preparedness to kill exceeds that of nonviolence.
It follows that architecting incentives to deescalate and redirect
violent tendencies for oneself becomes imperative whenever possible.
You can conclude that an imperfect situation warrants improvement,
that both blanking the slate and rebuilding anew would exact impose
incredible cost with a mere speculative chance of offsetting,
eventual gain.

There is another lingo of California that sounds in these
dilemmas---the lingo of "decentralization".  This has got hold of
the computer nerds---my tribe.  Decentralization, whatever that
means, is assuredly a form of direct action.  It puts the power to
obviate and circumvent powerful institutions in individuals' hands.
As software---often astoundingly brilliant stuff---there's little or
no risk of violence.  But its talismanic effect and moral peril of
secession disturb me greatly.

It begins with the "Cypherpunks" and "Cryptoanarchists".  The talismans
of these movements are the tools of cryptography.  In their heyday,
that meant one-way functions---mathematical operations that are
easy for computers to work from starting point to result, but
impractically difficult for anyone to work backwards from result to
starting point---and trapdoor functions---one-way functions that are
easy to reverse, but only with a specific hint.

As it turns out, these tools combine to achieve all manner of useful
tricks, from verifying the authenticity of documents to encrypting
messages and creating forgery-proof digital signatures.  These tools
embody natural power imbalances:  If John Q. Public uses [Transport
Layer Security] to read a blog, the NSA and their billions can't find
out whether he read the flan recipe or Revolutionary Council minutes.
If a lawyer encrypts a message to a client with [PGP], the other side
can't read it without the key.

[Transport Layer Security]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246

[PGP]: http://openpgp.org/

Those in-built power imbalances can be deployed to redress other,
irksome power imbalances that precede us on the Pale Blue Dot.
Among Cypherpunks and Cryptoanarchists, the imbalance of concern was
that between individual and the state.  Its symptoms are censorship
and surveillance, especially online.  There was also talk of proactive
applications, notably voting.

The Cypherpunks won a number of key battles, including legal battles,
to ensure the availability of tools governments weren't known to
circumvent.  They won widespread adoption for their approaches among
companies, notably to secure Internet-based commerce.   They fell flat
with tools for individual empowerment, which turned out to be finicky,
opaque, and staunchly resistant to non-wonk comprehension.

As it turned out, they still lost.  Companies that adopted
cryptography-based security to keep electronic commerce transactions
secure from thieves and fraudsters ended up at the helm of massive,
data-driven infrastructures amassing beaucoup data on pretty much
everyone online.  You know, for ads and stuff.  The government pressed
for access to this data, and either got it or took it.  So say the
slides Snowden snatched on the sly.

Meanwhile, the economy crashed, and all manner of the usual
government-cum-business skulduggery continued.  For a young man of
your author's generation, shuffled out into the economy in 2009, it
felt rather like the nation had been invaded by a Brooks Brothers-clad
army---pols, bankers, bureaucrats---who'd grabbed what they could,
wrecked the place, and taken flight to gated communities.

As it turned out, the beaucoup data people were also busy applying many
of the tools of Cryptoanarchism to more mundane problems of running
data centers massive enough to base all the data in need of databasing.
When you've more data to hold than any computer---even the biggest
hulk from IBM and friends---can carry, you have to use more than
one computer.  Making sure all the data goes on some computer, and
that all those many computers play a nice, happy family, is quite
a trick.  But the same cryptographic tools that make it hard to work
a puzzle backwards give such computers there wherewithal to dance a bit-data Horah
without stepping on each others' toes.  Bits of data go in the one-way
functions, and if the data is unique in the system, it's highly, highly
unlikely a previous solution for some other chunk of data comes out.
That shared bit of reliable coordination allows us to spread---or
"distribute"---the task of sharing beaucoup data across beaucoup
servers.

As usual, this excellent insight happened elsewhere first.
