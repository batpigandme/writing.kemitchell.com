Fellow deals lawyer, how many different choice-of-law clauses did you send out last year?

I have no idea, myself.  For a professional wordsmith, that leaves me feeling a bit a fraud.  Choice-of-law is pretty humdrum, as clauses go, sure.  But especially so, shouldn't I have one choice-of-law clause, the best one I know of, for each state whose law I routinely choose?

Bolt-on nondisclosure sections.  Warranty disclaimers.  Indemnities.  Indemnity procedures.  The list goes on.  All suspiciously ... diverse.  When opposing counsel drafts, I get what I get.  But when I'm sending out turn one, shouldn't my best work read more consistently, across deals and over time?

Review enough contracts, you get a feel for their piece-part structure.  Forms combine stock and a few feature ingredients.  Every form shows both a recipe for the kind of deal, and a complete example of terms, combining particular language-ingredients on hand when drafted.  Software license equals license grant, express warranties, disclaimers, plus delivery obligations, and so on.  Consulting agreement equals work terms, payment terms, independence reps, IP plus assignment terms, and so on.  The same ingredient may appear in several contracts, as the same bill-payment terms may recur in contracts for chemicals and motivational speaking.

As deals lawyers, we all get it.  Our structural understanding of contracts is universal in the practice, but not shared, and not effectively leveraged.  Apart from names for various kinds of agreements and recurring pieces---integration clause, damages exclusion, restricted stock purchase agreement, settlement agreement---the mix-and-match nature of our work doesn't show in our tools, workflows, or collaborative conventions.  Collectively, we're fairly efficient at wringing out fully prepped docs.  But the ways we communicate precursors to those drafts---recipes, ingredients, and substitutions---remain peculiar to specific lawyers, practice groups, or vendors, and mostly just ad hoc.

The most glaring manifestation is our failure to collaborate even with ourselves, on an individual basis, over time.  The Kyle E. Mitchell, attorney, practicing law today often lacks means to efficiently mooch off the Kyle E. Mitchell, attorney, who read up and drafted a plain-language clause from the case law months ago.  It costs to remember that you a good snippet, to find it, to copy it, and to work it in.  Those costs often outweigh the benefit you expect from replacing probably-good-enough with your current best.  Which is partly how we end up hocking competently made-to-order contracts from wilted, rotten language, and feeling, perpetually, as though circumstance has robbed us the chance of feeling expressed in our work.  The other end of the cost-benefit seesaw accounts for how damned expensive good help tends to be.

First-person failure sets us back a long way from effective collaboration involving more than one lawyer.  Ideally, deals law would be a far more social affair between rows, with robust trade in ingredients, ideas, and tools stoking competition at the margins.  In other words, a bit more like master-level arts and crafts, from cookery to dance to carpentry, which prove no less complex at their apexes, and often more competitive.  Transactional law would exact less collateral, personal damage if it offered a social fabric laid with the work itself, rather than coping mechanisms: escaping law firms for bars also full of lawyers, where we drink and kvetch ourselves to death among the fellow afflicted, gasping for camaraderie.

## Simple Tools

Maybe, long term, Ken Adams ends up writing all of our indemnification provisions.  But how will Ken's work make its way into our own?  When Ken's views evolve---along with his language---will we all have to copy and paste from a blog or book, into a million far-flung Word templates?  How will we disagree with him, if he's wrong?  How will the next Ken Adams start _their_ schism?

I've put time on these problems.  They involve a bit of futurism, a bit of what-if.  But I have a set of tools---really, a few general conventions---to offer.  Tools I've tried myself, and seen rejuvenate my contracts practice.
