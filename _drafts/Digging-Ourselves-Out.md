Fellow deals lawyer, how many different choice-of-law clauses did you send out last year?

I have no idea, myself, and for a professional wordsmith, I feel a bit a fraud.  Sure, choice-of-law is pretty humdrum.  But especially so, shouldn't I have _one_ choice-of-law clause, the best one I know of, for each state whose law I tend to choose?  Bolt-on nondisclosure sections.  Warranty disclaimers.  Indemnities.  Indemnity procedures.  So many bits and pieces, all suspiciously _diverse_.  When I'm sending out turn one, shouldn't my best work read more consistently, across deals and over time?

I don't know how many choice-of law clauses I sent out last year. But I will know this year. I've invested countless hours building tools.  Tools to make it more efficient to use my best than not to.  Tools for sharing and reusing work with others.  I want to put those tools in the hands of ever lawyer, right now, for free.

# Why?

As transactional lawyers, we understand the piece-part structure of contracts.  That understanding is universal in the practice, but not really shared, not effectively leveraged.  The most glaring manifestation is our failure to collaborate even with ourselves, on an individual basis, over time.  The Kyle E. Mitchell, attorney, drafting a contract today doesn't reliably mooch off the Kyle E. Mitchell, attorney of last week or last year.  The costs of remembering what I've done before, and actually redeploying it, often outweigh the benefit I expect from replacing probably-good-enough with my current best.  Which is how so many of us end up hocking contracts made to order from wilted, rotten language and feeling, perpetually, as though circumstance robs us of the chance to feel personally expressed in our work. Even as our clients wince at our cost.

First-person failure sets us back a long way from effective collaboration.  Ideally, deals law would be a more social affair between rows, with robust intercourse in ingredients, recipes, tools, and methods stoking competition at the cutting edge.  In other words, a bit more like other master-level pursuits, from cookery to carpentry, no less complex at their pinnacles, and often just as competitive.  Even when defined by competition, as in sport, those endeavors exact less collateral, personal damage, because camaraderie between bouts makes the practice itself rejuvenative.  Meanwhile, gaggles of lawyers flee their offices for bars also full of lawyers, where we drink and kvetch among the fellow afflicted to take out the sting of the day. Substance-abuse CLE and other symptomatic treatment won't dig law out of the hole it has dug.

## Picks & Shovels

Maybe, long term, Ken Adams ends up writing all of our indemnification provisions, and contract drafting looks more like building an outfit from clothes for sale online.  Very efficient.  But how will Ken's work make its way into our own?  When Ken's views evolve---along with his language---will we all have to copy and paste from a blog or a book into a million far-flung Word templates?  How will we disagree with him, if he's wrong?  How will the next Ken Adams start _their_ schism, and publish their own ready-made components?
