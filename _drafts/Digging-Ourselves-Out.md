Fellow deals lawyer, how many different choice-of-law clauses did _you_ send out last year?

I have no idea, myself.  For a professional wordsmith, that leaves me feeling a bit a fraud.  Choice-of-law is pretty humdrum, as clauses go, sure.  But _especially_ so, shouldn't I have _one_ choice-of-law clause, the _best_ one I know of, for each state whose law I routinely choose?

Bolt-on nondisclosure sections.  Warranty disclaimers.  Indemnities.  Indemnity _procedures_.  The list goes on.  All suspiciously...diverse.  When opposing counsel drafts, I get what I get.  But when _I'm_ sending out turn one, shouldn't my best work read more consistently, across deals and over time?

Review enough contracts, you get a feel for their piece-part structure.  Forms recombine stock ingredients.  Every form shows both a recipe for the kind of deal, and a complete example of terms, cooked up with the particular word-ingredients on-hand at the time.  Software license equals license grant, express warranties, disclaimers, plus delivery obligations, and so on.  Consulting agreement equals work terms, payment terms, independence reps, IP plus assignment terms, and so on.  The same ingredient may appear in several contracts.  The bill-payment terms in our software license and our consulting agreement may be the same.

As deals lawyers, we all get it.  But our understanding is widespread, not shared, and not effectively leveraged.  Apart from names for various recurring pieces---integration clause, damages exclusion, confidential information exceptions, and so on---the reusable nature of our work doesn't show in our tools, workflows, or collaborative conventions.  Collectively, we're a fairly efficient system for wrangling fully prepped drafts.  But we share precursors to those drafts---recipes, ingredients, and substitutions---in ways peculiar to specific lawyers and practice groups, and mostly ad hoc.

The most glaring manifestation is our failure to collaborate even with ourselves, on an individual basis, over time.  The Kyle E. Mitchell, attorney, practicing law today often lacks means to efficiently mooch off the Kyle E. Mitchell, attorney, who read up and [drafted a plain-language clause from the language of the case law months ago](https://commonform.org/goldplate/california-law/2e).  It costs to remember that you have a good example, to find it, to copy it, and to work it in.  Those costs often outweigh the benefit you expect from replacing probably-good-enough with your current best.  Which is part of how we end hocking made-to-order with limp ingredients, and feeling not particularly good about it.  And part of how it all costs so much.

That basic failure sets us back a long way from effective collaboration among practitioners.  Ideally, law would be a far more social affair, with robust intercourse in ingredients, ideas, and tools powering competition at the margins.  In other words, a bit more like the more vigorous arts and crafts, from cookery to dance and carpentry, which are no less complex, and often more competitive.  Practicing law would exact less collateral personal damage if it offered a social fabric folded along the work itself, rather than escaping work to drink and kvetch ourselves to death among similarly suffering colleagues.
