I'm a CEO.  I meet Bob at a conference.  We talk about my industry.  A week later, I contract Bob to write some software.  He spends ten hours and bills $3,000.  Everything goes well.  Bob's code works great.

Rewind the tape.

Bob and I have never met.  But Bob has read a few blogs about my industry.  Because of that reading, Bob decides some new software needs to exist in the universe.  He writes the software.  Bob's code works great.

_Then_ I show up.  We meet at a conference.  We talk about my industry.  A week later, I reach out to Bob to write some software.  But he's already written it.  He sends me a link to the GitHub repo.  It's all there, except for `LICENSE`.  So I pay Bob for a license.

I get the software I need.  Bob gets the money he needs.  And it's a good thing he does, because between conference and sale, Bob's partner's cancer comes back.

Now Bob is a full-time caregiver.  No more programming for Bob.  If he hadn't written the software before, he couldn't write it now.  And I'd be out of luck.

Rewind the tape again.

Bob writes the software.  We meet at the conference.  Bob links me to the repo.  It's all there, with MIT pasted into `LICENSE`, because GitHub told Bob to choose a license.

Bob's code works great.  I reach out to him two weeks later, about new features, support, and training.  But I can't hire Bob.  Bob's parter's cancer came back, and Bob's a full-time caregiver now.  No money for Bob.

## Time

Bob spent a ton of time becoming a programmer, and enough time learning about my industry to meet my business's needs.  All of that time and effort made Bob capable of spending the time to write the software I needed.

But I'm not really paying Bob for his time.  That's just a convenient way to decide how much I'll pay.  I'm really paying for the value of the results of Bob's time.  I'm paying for software that Bob can make, whether he's already made it or is about to make it.

Bob's hourly rate is $300.  If Bob spends ten hours creating new software for me, the cost of that software is $3,000.  If Bob had set his rate too low by half, spent five hours instead of ten, and delivered software that doesn't help me, I'd resent him.  I just wasted $1,500, plus all that time meeting, hiring, and paying him.  For nothing.  If Bob had set his rate twice as high and spent twice as much time, but his software saved me three times its cost, I'd sing Bob's praises.  Bob just made $12,000, but I made $24,000.

## Structure

If I hire Bob to spend the time making the software, he takes less risk than if he spends the time first, and hopes someone will show up to buy a license later.  On contract, Bob knows that he has at least one customer.

But I really don't care how much time it takes Bob to make the software.  That's just a handy way of deciding how much to pay him.  I care if Bob's software meets my needs at justifiable cost.  Frankly, I probably don't care whether Bob wrote it, or if somebody else did.  In the end, the software saves or makes money.  End of inquiry.

But things get more interesting.  I have competitors.  Naturally.  Those competitors could sure use Bob's software, too.  Naturally.

If I hire Bob under standard contract terms, I own the software Bob makes.  Bob can't sell it to my competitors, or even tell them it exists, even though they'd gladly pay to use it.  The software is _mine_, not Bob's, because the contract I have with Bob says so.

Hopefully Bob priced accordingly.  But that will be hard for Bob.  I probably know a lot more about my industry and my competitors---Bob's potential market---than Bob does.

Maybe Bob could have charged me $30,000 instead of $3,000.  Maybe it's actually worth $100,000 to my business.  But $3,000 per hour is an exorbitant hourly rate.  Pretending that I pay for Bob's time, rather than Bob's software, conveniently avoids the question of value.

That's contracting.  Constrast licensing.

If I pay Bob for a license under typical license terms, Bob stills owns his software, and can sell licenses to others.  If he finds out about my competitors, or they find out about him, he can potentially make far more.

That's true even if Bob's partner's cancer comes back, and he can't do programming or make deals full-time.  Perhaps Bob sets up a web store, and sells licenses that way.  Perhaps Bob sells subscription-style license agreements that require customer to pay each month or each year.  Perhaps Bob hires an agent, or find a partner, who sells licenses for him, and takes commission.

If Bob can't work, eventually his software will lose value.  Bob won't be able to fix bugs, add new features, update for changes in other software, or provide related services like integration, training, or support.  But if Bob makes money from licensing software he's already written, he might be able hire others to do what he can't, going forward.

## Footing

Licensing gives programmers flexibility in time.  It transforms their work from an exchange of money for time into an exchange of money for software.  It gives them a means of earning---royalties---that can reflect the value of their work, rather than the time put into it.

Licensing allows programmers to invest their time, rather than simply exchange it.  The value they build up in accumulated software that they can license can pays like stock in a company, ownership of a valuable asset, or accumulated reputation, rather than a paycheck.  That gives programmers the power to set themselves apart as entrepreneurs, rather than human resources.  It ruptures incentives to spend more time than necessary, to deliver no more than necessary, and places the focus on the value of product.
