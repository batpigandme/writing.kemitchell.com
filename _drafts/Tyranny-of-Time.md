brief: Treating licensing as taboo holds developers back.

If you polled open software pundits, I think their sentiment would say:  Hiring good.  Licensing bad.

I don't get it.  And I don't like the consequences.

In the end, software is useful, people will pay for it, and it takes time to make.  The _structure_ of a producer-consumer relationship---employment, contract, or license---doesn't determine value, but merely reflects it.  Different structures afford flexibility to reorder development, payment, and permission in time.  Writing one approach---licensing---off as evil surrenders most of that flexibility.

It gets worse when we see how different structures play out in practice.  Tradition and inertia constrain employment and contracting.  Norms are deeply ingrained, long predate the software industry, and hold many developers back late in their careers.  Promoting pay for time, and deprecating pay for permission, encourages developers to sell themselves short, to keep punching the clock for others when they could be making entrepreneurial bets for themselves.

Let's break it down through a story.  We'll play it as theme and variations.

## First

I'm a CEO.  I meet Bob at a conference.  We talk about my industry.

A week later, I contract Bob to write some software.  He spends ten hours and bills $3,000.  Everything goes well.  Bob's code works great.

Rewind the tape.

## Second

Bob and I have never met, but Bob has read a few blogs about my industry.  Because of his reading, Bob decides some new software needs to exist in the universe.  He writes the software.  Bob's code works great.

_Then_ I show up.  We meet at a conference.  We talk about my industry.

A week later, I reach out to Bob to write some software.  But he's already written it.  He sends me a link to the GitHub repo.  It's all there, except for `LICENSE`.  So I pay Bob for a license.

I get the software I need.  Bob gets the money he needs.  And it's a good thing he does, because between conference and sale, Bob's partner's cancer comes back.

Now Bob is a full-time caregiver.  No more programming for Bob.  If he hadn't written the software before, he couldn't write it now.  And I'd be out of luck.

Rewind the tape again.

## Third

Bob writes the software.  We meet at the conference.  Bob links me to the repo.  It's all there, with MIT pasted into `LICENSE`, because GitHub told Bob to choose a license.

Bob's code works great.  I reach out to him two weeks later, about new features, support, and training.  But I can't hire Bob.  Bob's partner's cancer came back, and Bob's a full-time caregiver now.  No money for Bob.  No features, support, or training for me.

## Time

One programmer.  One piece of software.  Three different stories.  Three very different outcomes.

In each story, Bob spent a ton of time becoming a programmer and enough time learning about my industry to meet my business needs.  All of that time and effort made Bob capable of spending the time he needed to write the software that I needed.

But in no story did I really pay Bob for time.  Multiplying time spent by a cost per hour was just a convenient way to decide how much I'd pay.  I really paid for the value of the results of Bob's time.  I paid for the software that Bob could make, whether he'd already made it or was available to make it.

Say Bob's hourly rate were $300.  If Bob spent ten hours creating new software for me, the cost of that software would be $3,000.

If Bob had set his rate too low by half and delivered software that didn't meet my needs, I'd pay Bob far less, but likely resent him.  I'd've wasted $1,500, plus all that time meeting, hiring, and paying Bob for nothing useful.

Conversely, if Bob had set his rate twice as high, and spent twice as much time, but his software saved me three times its cost, I'd sing Bob's praises.  Bob just helped me make $24,000.

I don't care how much time Bob takes to make the software.  Unless the time Bob takes determines whether I can get my hands on the software in time to meet my business need, in which case I'd prefer above all to learn that he's already written it.  Or unless I sign a contract with Bob that says how much time he takes determines how much I'll pay.

## Structure

If I hire Bob to spend the time making new software, he takes less risk than if he spends the time first, and hopes someone will show up to buy a license later.  On contract, or as an employee, Bob knows that he has at least one paying customer, if only one paying customer.  Without a contract, Bob hopes he'll find one.  One at least.

I have competitors.  Naturally.  Those competitors could sure use Bob's software, too.  Naturally.

If I hire Bob under standard employee or contractor terms, I own the software Bob makes.  Bob can't sell it to my competitors, or even tell them it exists.  The software is _mine_, not Bob's, because the terms I signed with Bob say so.

Hopefully Bob priced accordingly.  But that will be hard for Bob.  I probably know a lot more about my industry and my competitors---Bob's potential market---than Bob does.  I might even insist on owning Bob's software so that _I_ can turn around and sell licenses to others, without sharing the earnings with Bob.

Maybe Bob could have charged me $30,000 instead of $3,000.  Maybe it's actually worth $100,000 to my business.  But here's the catch: $3,000 per hour is an exorbitant hourly rate!

Why?  Is there a glut of available programming talent, similarly read up on my industry and interested in solving the problem?  Are they easy to find, and available to hire?  Why should they do the work for less, if the value to my business remains the same?  Do we assume developers ought to be grateful for whatever work they can get?

Pretending that I pay for Bob's time, rather than Bob's software, distracts from the question of value.  As any business hires an employee in anticipation of making more on their work than it pays them in salary and benefits, I can hire Bob in anticipation of making more from his software than I pay for his time.  And it behooves me to change the game from identifying a license price based on the value to my business, which puts me in an awkward bargaining position, to justifying Bob's compensation against that of other programmers, which puts Bob in an awkward bargaining position.

## Restructure

That's employee-contractor normal.  Contrast licensing.

If I pay Bob for a license under typical license terms, Bob stills owns his software, and can sell licenses to others.  If he finds out about my competitors, or they find out about him, he might make far more, selling more licenses.

That's true even if Bob's partner's cancer comes back, and he can't make software or deals full-time.  Perhaps Bob sets up a web store, and sells licenses that way.  Perhaps Bob sells subscription-style license agreements that require customer to pay each month or each year, whether he sends updates or not.  Perhaps Bob hires an agent, or finds a partner, who sells licenses for him, and takes commission.

If Bob can't work, eventually his software will lose value.  Bob won't be able to fix bugs, add new features, update for changes in other software, or provide related services like integration, training, or support.  But if Bob makes money from licensing software he's already written, he might be able hire others to do what he can't, going forward.  For example, he might hire another developer to maintain his work, and keep it relevant, so that new customers continue buying licenses.

A license _could_ produce much the same result as a typical employment or contracting relationship.  Bob could license his software to me exclusively, meaning he can't license it to anyone else.  Bob could license his software to me with rights to resell without royalty, allowing me to tell Bob's software to others without compensating Bob.  I could agree to pay a one-time license fee based on Bob's report of how much time he spent creating the software.  But all of those terms are unusual in licenses, even if they're typical in employee and contractor terms.

## Footing

Licensing gives creators flexibility in time.  It transforms their economics relationships with users from an exchange of money for work time into an exchange of money for work product.  It gives creators a means of earning---royalties---that can reflect the value of their work, rather than the time put into it.

Licensing allows programmers to invest their time, rather than simply exchange it.  The value they build up in accumulated software that they can license can pays like stock in a company, ownership of a valuable asset, or accumulated reputation, rather than a paycheck.  That decoupling of time spent and earnings received gives programmers the option to become entrepreneurs, rather than human resources.  It ruptures standard human-resource incentives to spend more time than necessary, and deliver no more than necessary, by shifting the economic focus onto the value of the software.

There is no reason this can't happen in the structure of a contracting or employment arrangement.  Some well established developers _do_ make large multiples of typical hourly work rates.
