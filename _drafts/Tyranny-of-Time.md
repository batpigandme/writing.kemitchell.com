I'm a CEO.  I meet Bob at a conference.  We talk about my industry.  A week later, I contract Bob to write some software.  He spends ten hours and bills me $3,000.  Everything goes well.  Bob's software works great.

Rewind the tape.

Bob and I have never met.  But Bob has read a few blogs about my industry, and Bob decides some new software needs to exist in the universe.  He writes the software.  Bob's software works great.

_Then_ I show up.  We meet at a conference.  We talk about software in my industry.  A week later, I reach out to Bob to write some software.  But he's already written it---even better.  He sends me a link to the GitHub repository.  It's all there, except for `LICENSE`.  So I pay Bob for a license.

I get the software I need.  Bob gets the money he needs.  And it's a good thing he does, because between conference and sale, Bob's partner's cancer comes back.

Now Bob is a full-time caregiver.  No programming for Bob.  If he hadn't written the software before, he couldn't write it now.  I'd be out of luck.

Bob spent a ton of time becoming a programmer.  Bob spent enough time learning about my industry to understand my needs.  That made Bob capable of spending time writing to write the software I needed.  But he spent that time before I paid him to.  He speculated a bit.  Took a bet that _someone_ would pay for his work, before that someone was me.

I can hire Bob to spend that time, if he's available.  He may not be.  But assuming he is, when I do hire him, I'm not really paying for his time.  That's just the most efficient way to decide how much he should charge me.  In reality, I'm paying for the _result_ of Bob's time.  I'm paying for software that Bob can make, whether he's already made it or is about to make it.

Bob's hourly rate is $300.  If Bob spends ten hours creating new software for me, the cost of that software is $3,000.

If Bob had set his rate too low by half, spent five hours instead of ten, and delivered software that doesn't help me, I'd resent his ass.  I just wasted $1,500, plus all that time meeting, hiring, and paying him.  For nothing.

I really don't care how much time it took, or takes, Bob to make the software that's good for me.  I care if Bob's software---actually, I don't care if Bob makes it or somebody else makes it---meets my needs.  It saves or makes money.  It treats or prevents my pain.  End of inquiry.

But things get more interesting.  I have competitors.  Naturally.  Those competitors could sure use Bob's software, too.  Naturally.

If I hire Bob under standard work-for-hire terms, I own the software Bob makes.  Bob can't sell it to my competitors, even though they'd gladly pay.  The software is _mine_, because I paid for the time that made it exist.

Hopefully Bob prices accordingly.  But how could he?  I know more about my industry, my competitors, Bob's market, than Bob does.
