Everyone who reads my blog ought to read [Bradley Kuhn](http://ebb.org/bkuhn/blog/)'s, too.  Bradley's writing is always worth the candle.  I say that not because I agree with him.  During my own readership, I often haven't.  But that has made reading all the more essential.

Case in point:  I think Bradley's written [one of the best pieces on Commons Clause](http://ebb.org/bkuhn/blog/2018/08/22/commons-clause.html) to date.  But I don't agree with it.  Not in many details.  But not at the level of the broader framework he offers in passing, either.  I'd quibble with many of the premises, but that would be to shoot well below the mark.  It's at the higher level where I hope we and others can have the conversation that matters.

# Say It: Power

No one has so consistently written of matters free and open source in direct terms of power.  I wholeheartedly agree:

> Proprietary software has always been about a power relationship.

True.  Emphatically true.  I would say:  Given how true, oddly understated.  Bordering even on wrong, not on its own terms, but by omission, by selective focus.

To be cute: copyleft is also about a power relationship.  The disarmament copyleft induces, when it works, when it's enforced by whatever means, is likewise involuntary, a derogation from the defaults set by law and practical circumstance.  So we could refine:

> Software production, disclosure, and licensing have always been about a power relationship.

But we still haven't brought Commons Clause back into the picture.  There is another sinful omission to correct:

> Software production, disclosure, and licensing have always been about _power relationships_.

Commons Clause's messaging has been hasty, reactive, and fumbling from the get-go.  I get the sense the get-go came ahead of schedule.  Somebody jumped the gun.  But to the credit of those involved, there has been a single cross-cutting consistency: for those adopting, this is about cloud providers.  The power struggle is _between new producers and incumbents_.  That's why idealistic, open-leaning software people put their hands, reluctantly, on the levers of license power.

[Quoth Redis Labs](https://redislabs.com/community/licenses/):

> Modern open source infrastructure software has created more value over the past decade than we could have ever imagined ... all thanks to the shared, collaborative philosophy of the open source community.
>
> However, today's cloud providers have repeatedly violated this ethos by taking advantage of successful open source projects and repackaging them into competitive, proprietary service offerings.  Cloud providers contribute very little (if anything) to those open source projects. Instead, they use their monopolistic nature to derive hundreds of millions dollars in revenues from them.  Already, this behavior has damaged open source communities and put some of the companies that support them out of business.

Prime and secondary movers behind Commons Clause have named their target.  They are punching up, from the level of startups to the level of the Amazons and well capitalized follow-ons.  They are _not_ punching down at end-users.  They wrong those folks, if at all, only by accepting a measure of collateral damage in their kind.

Concretely:  Current end-users of select add-ons to Redis will have to assess a new set of license terms, and some will fall outside the public grant, or tap out before any actionable conclusion.  They'll land on the paying side of the new dual licensing wedge that is something plus Commons Clause.  They will have to freeze on a current version, which they wanted to do anyway, or e-mail Redis Labs.  Send the e-mail, one thing leads to another, they may pay a fee for ongoing maintenance.

But who are these end-users?  With discountable exception, there aren't any.

Redis is an in-memory database.  It's still BSD-licensed.  The license terms for _future_ versions of some configurable add-ons to that database used to be free-open-policy-approved, and are now under something marginally easier to analyze than [CC-BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

"An in-memory database with a full-text search plugin" is not an answer to any end-user need.  In-memory databases with search plugins don't solve end-user problems.  They solve intermediate problems for software developers who deliver products and services that solve end-user needs.

Rote invocation of the four freedoms collapses this reality, attempts to reduce it to a simple question of freedom or nonfreedom, and a single power relationship.  It surveys the relationships and play, and concludes, tacitly, that software freedom, which appeals innately only to software people, steers the whole moral inquiry, because, in the end, software people are talking, and software people know better.  Amazon's quasi-monopoly in service doesn't stack up to Redis Labs' quasi-monopoly on patches to add-ons it will write tomorrow.   Somehow.
