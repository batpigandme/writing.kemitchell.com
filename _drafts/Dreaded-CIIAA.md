Consultant will promptly make full written disclosure to the Company, will hold in trust for the sole right and benefit of the Company, and hereby assigns to the Company, or its designee, all of Consultant's right, title and interest throughout the world in and to any and all Company Inventions and all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights therein.  Consultant hereby waives and irrevocably quitclaims to the Company or its designee any and all claims, of any nature whatsoever, that Consultant now has or may hereafter have for infringement of any and all Company Inventions.  Any assignment of Company Inventions includes all rights of attribution, paternity, integrity, modification, disclosure and withdrawal, and any other rights throughout the world that may be known as or referred to as "moral rights," "artist's rights," "droit moral," or the like (collectively, "Moral Rights").  To the extent that Moral Rights cannot be assigned under applicable law, Consultant hereby waives and agrees not to enforce any and all Moral Rights, including, without limitation, any limitation on subsequent modification, to the extent permitted under applicable law.  If Consultant has any rights to the Company Inventions, other than Moral Rights, that cannot be assigned to the Company, Consultant hereby unconditionally and irrevocably grants to the Company during the term of such rights, an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, fully paid and royalty-free license, with rights to sublicense through multiple levels of sublicensees, to reproduce, distribute, display, perform, prepare derivative works of and otherwise modify, make, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, practice methods, processes and procedures and otherwise use and exploit, such Company Inventions.
>
> (e) **Maintenance of Records**.  Consultant shall keep and maintain adequate and current written records of all Company Inventions made or conceived by Consultant or Consultant's personnel (solely or jointly with others) during the term of the Relationship.  The records may be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, flow charts, electronic data or recordings, laboratory notebooks, or any other format.  The records will be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times.  Consultant shall not remove such records from the Company's place of business or systems except as expressly permitted by Company policy which may, from time to time, be revised at the sole election of the Company for the purpose of furthering the Company's business.  Consultant shall deliver all such records (including any copies thereof) to the Company at the time of termination of the Relationship as provided for in Section 6 and Section 7.

Consultant shall assist the Company, or its designee, at its expense, in every proper way in securing the Company's, or its designee's, rights in the Company Inventions and any copyrights, patents, trademarks, mask work rights, Moral Rights, or other intellectual property rights relating thereto in any and all countries, including the disclosure to the Company or its designee of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments, recordations, and all other instruments which the Company or its designee shall deem necessary in order to apply for, obtain, maintain and transfer such rights, or if not transferable, waive and shall never assert such rights, and in order to assign and convey to the Company or its designee, and any successors, assigns and nominees the sole and exclusive right, title and interest in and to such Company Inventions, and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto.  Consultant's obligation to execute or cause to be executed, when it is in Consultant's power to do so, any such instrument or papers shall continue during and at all times after the end of the Relationship and until the expiration of the last such intellectual property right to expire in any country of the world.

This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall not be affected by Consultant's subsequent incapacity.
>
> (g) **Exception to Assignments**.  Subject to the requirements of applicable state law, if any, Consultant understands that the Company Inventions will not include, and the provisions of this Agreement requiring assignment of inventions to the Company do not apply to, any invention which qualifies fully for exclusion under the provisions of applicable state law, if any[, attached hereto as Exhibit B].  In order to assist in the determination of which inventions qualify for such exclusion, Consultant will advise the Company promptly in writing, during and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of the Relationship, of all Inventions solely or jointly conceived or developed or reduced to practice by Consultant or Consultant's personnel in connection with, or as a result of, the Services performed for the Company during the period of the Relationship.

Consultant further acknowledges that any property situated on the Company's premises or systems and owned by the Company, including disks and other storage media, filing cabinets or other work areas, is subject to inspection by Company personnel at any time with or without notice.  At the time of termination of the Relationship, Consultant will deliver to the Company (and will not keep in Consultant's possession, recreate or deliver to anyone else) any and all devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, laboratory notebooks, materials, flow charts, equipment, other documents or property, or reproductions of any of the aforementioned items developed by Consultant or Consultant's personnel pursuant to the Relationship or otherwise belonging to the Company, its successors or assigns.
>
> 7. **Termination Certification**.  In the event of the termination of the Relationship, Consultant shall sign and deliver the "Termination Certification" attached hereto as Exhibit [C/ B]; however, Consultant's failure to sign and deliver the Termination Certification shall in no way diminish Consultant's continuing obligations under this Agreement.
>
> 8. **Notice to Third Parties**.  During the periods of time during which Consultant is restricted in taking certain actions by the terms of Section 9 of this Agreement (the "Restriction Period"), Consultant shall inform any entity or person with whom Consultant may seek to enter into a business relationship (whether as an owner, employee, independent contractor or otherwise) of Consultant's contractual obligations under this Agreement.

> 10. **No Change to Duration of Relationship**.  Consultant understands and acknowledges that this Agreement does not alter, amend or expand upon any rights Consultant may have to continue in the consulting relationship with, or in the duration of Consultant's consulting relationship with, the Company under any existing agreements between the Company and Consultant, including without limitation the Consulting Agreement, or under applicable law.
>
> 11. **Representations and Covenants**.
>
> (a) **Facilitation of Agreement**.  Consultant shall execute promptly, both during and after the end of the Relationship, any proper oath, and to verify any proper document, required to carry out the terms of this Agreement, upon the Company's written request to do so.
>
> (b) **No Conflicts**.  Consultant represents and warrants that Consultant's performance of all the terms of this Agreement does not and will not breach any agreement Consultant has entered into, or will enter into, with any third party, including without limitation any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information or materials acquired by Consultant in confidence or in trust prior to or during the Relationship.  Consultant will not disclose to the Company or use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party.  Consultant will not induce the Company to use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information, or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party.  Consultant represents and warrants that Consultant has listed on Exhibit [D/ C] all agreements (e.g., non-competition agreements, non-solicitation of customers agreements, non-solicitation of employees agreements, confidentiality agreements, inventions agreements, etc.), if any, with a current or former client, employer, or any other person or entity, that may restrict Consultant's ability to perform services for the Company or Consultant's ability to recruit or engage customers or service providers on behalf of the Company, or otherwise relate to or restrict Consultant's ability to perform Consultant's duties for the Company or any obligation Consultant may have to the Company.  Consultant shall not enter into any written or oral agreement that conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement.
>
> Consultant further represents that Consultant does not presently perform or intend to perform, during the term of the Consulting Agreement, consulting or other services for, and Consultant is not presently employed by and has no intention of being employed by, companies whose businesses or proposed businesses in any way involve products or services that would be competitive with the Company's products or services, or those products or services proposed or in development by the Company during the term of the Consulting Agreement (except for those companies, if any, listed on Exhibit [D/ C] attached hereto).  If, however, Consultant decides to do so, Consultant agrees that, in advance of accepting such employment or agreeing to perform such services, Consultant will promptly notify the Company in writing, specifying the organization to which Consultant proposes to render services, and provide information sufficient to allow the Company to determine if such work would conflict with the interests of the Company.
>
> (c) **Voluntary Execution**.  Consultant certifies and acknowledges that Consultant has carefully read all of the provisions of this Agreement, that Consultant understands and has voluntarily accepted such provisions, and that Consultant will fully and faithfully comply with such provisions.
>
> 12. **Electronic Delivery**.  Nothing herein is intended to imply a right to participate in any of the Company's equity incentive plans, however, if Consultant does participate in such plan(s), the Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to Consultant's participation in the Company's equity incentive plan(s) by electronic means or to request Consultant's consent to participate in such plan(s) by electronic means.  Consultant hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees, if applicable, to participate in such plan(s) through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.
>
> 13. **Miscellaneous**.
>
> (a) **Governing Law**.  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement, and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of [In many cases this should be the state where the service provider is located -- California, Kansas, Illinois, Minnesota and Washington may require that certain code sections are attached for individuals] ________________, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.
>
> (b) **Entire Agreement**.  Except as described in Section 3, this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and Consultant relating to its subject matter and merges all prior discussions between the parties to this Agreement.  No amendment to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing signed by both parties to this Agreement.  The Company shall not be deemed hereby to have waived any rights or remedies it may have in law or equity, nor to have given any authorizations or waived any of its rights under this Agreement, unless, and only to the extent, it does so by a specific writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company.  Any subsequent change or changes in Consultant's duties, obligations, rights or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.
>
> (c) **Successors and Assigns**.  This Agreement will be binding upon Consultant's successors and assigns, and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns.
>
> (d) **Notices**.  Any notice, demand or request required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or by overnight courier or sent by email, or 48 hours after being deposited in the U.S. mail as certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the party to be notified at such party's address as set forth on the signature page, as subsequently modified by written notice, or if no address is specified on the signature page, at the most recent address set forth in the Company's books and records.
>
> (e) **Severability**.  If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void or unenforceable to any extent in any context, such provisions shall nevertheless be enforced to the fullest extent allowed by law in that and other contexts, and the validity and force of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected.  The Company and Consultant have attempted to limit Consultant's right to use, maintain and disclose the Company's Confidential Information, and to limit Consultant's right to solicit employees and customers only to the extent necessary to protect the Company from unfair competition.  Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that the scope of the covenants contained in Section 9 exceeds the maximum restrictiveness such court deems reasonable and enforceable, the parties intend that the court should reform, modify and enforce the provision to such narrower scope as it determines to be reasonable and enforceable under the circumstances existing at that time.  In the event that any court or government agency of competent jurisdiction determines that, notwithstanding the terms of the Consulting Agreement specifying Consultant's Relationship with the Company as that of an independent contractor, Consultant's provision of services to the Company is not as an independent contractor but instead as an employee under the applicable laws, then solely to the extent that such determination is applicable, references in this Agreement to the Relationship between Consultant and the Company shall be interpreted to include an employment relationship, and this Agreement shall not be invalid and unenforceable but shall be read to the fullest extent as may be valid and enforceable under the applicable laws to carry out the intent and purpose of this Agreement.
>
> (f) **Remedies**.  Consultant acknowledges that violation of this Agreement by Consultant may cause the Company irreparable harm, and therefore Consultant agrees that the Company will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including, but not limited to, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security (or, where such a bond or security is required, that a $1,000 bond will be adequate), in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement.
>
> (g) **Advice of Counsel**.  Consultant acknowledges THAT, IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, Consultant Has HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND Consultant Has read and understands ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY PARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION HEREOF.
>
> (h) **Counterparts**.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.  Execution of a facsimile or scanned copy will have the same force and effect as execution of an original, and a facsimile or scanned signature will be deemed an original and valid signature.

Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign or offer to assign any of the employee's rights in an invention to the employer shall not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facility or trade secret information of the employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employee's own time, and (1) which does not relate (a) directly to the business of the employer or (b) to the employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (2) which does not result from any work performed by the employee for the employer. Any provision which purports to apply to such an invention is to that extent against the public policy of this state and is to that extent void and unenforceable.
