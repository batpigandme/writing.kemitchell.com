You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product documentation located at <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting>.  There may also be some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications.  If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with Microsoft's privacy statement.  Our privacy statement is located at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704>.  You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement.  Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.

To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at <https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733>.
>
> 3.  **UPDATES**.  The software may periodically check for updates and download and install them for you.  You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources.

Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.  If you do not want automatic updates, you may turn them off by following the instructions in the documentation at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616397>.
>
> 4.  **FEEDBACK**.  If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose.  You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we include your feedback in them.  These rights survive this agreement.
>
> 5.  **SCOPE OF LICENSE**.  This license applies to the Visual Studio Code product.  Source code for Visual Studio Code is available at <https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode> under the MIT license agreement.  The software is licensed, not sold.  This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software.  Microsoft reserves all other rights.  Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.  In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways.  You may not

>
>     - share, publish, rent or lease the software, or provide the software as a stand-alone offering for others to use.
>
> 6.  **SUPPORT SERVICES**.  Because this software is "as is," we may not provide support services for it.
>
> 7.  **ENTIRE AGREEMENT**.  This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
>
> 8.  **EXPORT RESTRICTIONS**.  You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end-users, and end use.  For further information on export restrictions, see <https://www.microsoft.com/exporting>.
>
> 9.  **APPLICABLE LAW**.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims.  If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.
>
> 10. **CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS**.  This agreement describes certain legal rights.  You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country.  Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software.  This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.  For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
>
>     1.  **Australia**.  You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
>
>     2.  **Canada**.  If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software.  The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
>
>     3.  **Germany and Austria**.
>
>         1.  **Warranty**.  The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software.  However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.
>
>         2.  **Limitation of Liability**.  In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.
>
>     Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations").  In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.
>
> 11. **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY**.  **The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it.  Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions.  To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.**
>
> 12. **LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES**.  **You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00.  You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.**
>
>     This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
>
>     It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.  The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

> # Microsoft Privacy Statement
>
> Last Updated: January 2020 What's new?
>
> Your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains the personal data Microsoft processes, how Microsoft processes it, and for what purposes.
>
> Microsoft offers a wide range of products, including server products used to help operate enterprises worldwide, devices you use in your home, software that students use at school, and services developers use to create and host what’s next. References to Microsoft products in this statement include Microsoft services, websites, apps, software, servers, and devices.
>
> Please read the product-specific details in this privacy statement, which provide additional relevant information. This statement applies to the interactions Microsoft has with you and the Microsoft products listed below, as well as other Microsoft products that display this statement.
>
> ## Cookies
>
> Most Microsoft sites use cookies, small text files placed on your device which web servers in the domain that placed the cookie can retrieve later. We use cookies to store your preferences and settings, help with sign-in, provide targeted ads, and analyze site operations. For more information, see the Cookies and similar technologies section of this privacy statement.
>
> ## EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
>
> Microsoft adheres to the principles of the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks. To learn more, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website.
>
> ## Contact us
>
> If you have a privacy concern, complaint, or question for the Microsoft Chief Privacy Officer or EU Data Protection Officer, please contact us by using our web form. For more information about contacting Microsoft, including Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, see the How to contact us section of this privacy statement.
>
> ## Personal data we collect
>
> Microsoft collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products. You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Microsoft and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.
>
> If you represent an organization, such as a business or school, that utilizes Enterprise and Developer Products from Microsoft, please see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data. If you are an end user of a Microsoft product or a Microsoft account provided by your organization, please see the Products provided by your organization and the Microsoft account sections for more information.
>
> You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data required to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use such data will not work for you.
>
> ## How we use personal data
>
> Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to:
>
> - Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.
>
> - Improve and develop our products.
>
> - Personalize our products and make recommendations.
>
> - Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.
>
> - We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.
>
> In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.
>
> Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do. To build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made. For example, we manually review short snippets of a small sampling of voice data we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech services, such as recognition and translation.
>
> ## Reasons we share personal data
>
> We share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. We also share data with Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights and property of Microsoft and its customers.
>
> ## How to access and control your personal data
>
> You can also make choices about the collection and use of your data by Microsoft. You can control your personal data that Microsoft has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, by contacting Microsoft or using various tools we provide. In some cases, your ability to access or control your personal data will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law. How you can access or control your personal data will also depend on which products you use. For example, you can:
>
> - Control the use of your data for interest-based advertising from Microsoft by visiting our opt-out page.
>
> - Choose whether you wish to receive promotional emails, SMS messages, telephone calls, and postal mail from Microsoft.
>
> - Access and clear some of your data through the Microsoft privacy dashboard.
>
> Not all personal data processed by Microsoft can be accessed or controlled via the tools above. If you want to access or control personal data processed by Microsoft that is not available via the tools above or directly through the Microsoft products you use, you can always contact Microsoft at the address in the How to contact us section or by using our web form.
>
> We provide aggregate metrics about user requests to exercise their data protection rights via the Microsoft Privacy Report.
>
> ## Cookies and similar technologies
>
> Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. We use cookies and similar technologies for storing and honoring your preferences and settings, enabling you to sign in, providing interest-based advertising, combating fraud, analyzing how our products perform, and fulfilling other legitimate purposes. Microsoft apps use additional identifiers, such as the advertising ID in Windows described in the Advertising ID section of this privacy statement, for similar purposes.
>
> We also use “web beacons” to help deliver cookies and gather usage and performance data. Our websites may include web beacons, cookies, or similar technologies from third-party service providers.
>
> You have a variety of tools to control the data collected by cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. For example, you can use controls in your internet browser to limit how the websites you visit are able to use cookies and to withdraw your consent by clearing or blocking cookies.
>
> ## Products provided by your organization—notice to end users
>
> If you use a Microsoft product provided by an organization you are affiliated with, such as an employer or school, and you use your work or school account to access that Microsoft product, that organization can:
>
> - Control and administer your Microsoft product and product account, including controlling privacy-related settings of the product or product account.
>
> - Access and process your data, including the interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files associated with your Microsoft product and product accounts.
>
> - If you lose access to your work or school account (in event of change of employment, for example), you may lose access to products and the content associated with those products, including those you acquired on your own behalf, if you used your work or school account to sign in to such products.
>
> Many Microsoft products are intended for use by organizations, such as schools and businesses. Please see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement. If your organization provides you with access to Microsoft products, your use of the Microsoft products is subject to your organization's policies, if any. You should direct your privacy inquiries, including any requests to exercise your data protection rights, to your organization’s administrator. When you use social features in Microsoft products, other users in your network may see some of your activity. To learn more about the social features and other functionality, please review documentation or help content specific to the Microsoft product. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this privacy statement.
>
> When you use a Microsoft product provided by your organization, Microsoft’s processing of your personal data in connection with that product is governed by a contract between Microsoft and your organization. Microsoft processes your personal data to provide the product to your organization and you, and for Microsoft’s legitimate business operations related to providing the product as described in the Enterprise and developer products section. As mentioned above, if you have questions about Microsoft’s processing of your personal data in connection with providing products to your organization, please contact your organization. If you have questions about Microsoft’s legitimate business operations in connection with providing products to your organization, please contact Microsoft as described in the How to contact us section. For more information on our legitimate business operations, please see the Enterprise and developer products section.

>
> - not sell or rent student personal data;
>

>
> - not build a personal profile of a student, other than for supporting authorized educational or school purposes or as authorized by the parent, guardian, or student of appropriate age; and
>
> - require that our vendors with whom student personal data is shared to deliver the educational service, if any, are obligated to implement these same commitments for student personal data.
>
> ## Microsoft account
>
> With a Microsoft account, you can sign in to Microsoft products, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. Personal data associated with your Microsoft account includes credentials, name and contact data, payment data, device and usage data, your contacts, information about your activities, and your interests and favorites. Signing in to your Microsoft account enables personalization and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other features.
>
> There are three types of Microsoft account:
>
> - When you create your own Microsoft account tied to your personal email address, we refer to that account as a **personal Microsoft account**.
>
> - When you or your organization (such as an employer or your school) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address provided by that organization, we refer to that account as a **work or school account**.
>
> - When you or your service provider (such as a cable or internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider’s domain, we refer to that account as a **third-party account**.
>
> If you sign into a service offered by a third party with your Microsoft account, you will share with that third party the account data required by that service.
>
> ## Other important privacy information
>
> Below you will find additional privacy information, such as how we secure your data, where we process your data, and how long we retain your data. You can find more information on Microsoft and our commitment to protecting your privacy at Microsoft Privacy.

>
> ***You can also learn more about our Enterprise and Developer Products’ features and settings, including choices that impact your privacy or your end users’ privacy, in product documentation.***
>

>
> **General**. When a customer tries, purchases, uses, or subscribes to Enterprise and Developer Products, or obtains support for or professional services with such products, Microsoft receives data from you and collects and generates data to provide the service (including improving, securing, and updating the service), conduct our legitimate business operations, and communicate with the customer. For example:
>
> - When a customer engages with a Microsoft sales representative, we collect the customer’s name and contact data, along with information about the customer’s organization, to support that engagement.
>
> - When a customer interacts with a Microsoft support professional, we collect device and usage data or error reports to diagnose and resolve problems.
>
> - When a customer pays for products, we collect contact and payment data to process the payment.
>
> - When Microsoft sends communications to a customer, we use data to personalize the content of the communication.
>
> - When a customer engages with Microsoft for professional services, we collect the name and contact data of the customer’s designated point of contact and use information provided by the customer to perform the services that the customer has requested.
>
> The Enterprise and Developer Products enable you to purchase, subscribe to, or use other products and online services from Microsoft or third parties with different privacy practices, and those other products and online services are governed by their respective privacy statements and policies.

> ## Productivity and communications products

> Productivity and communications products are applications, software, and services you can use to create, store, and share documents, as well as communicate with others.
>
> ## Search, Microsoft Edge, and artificial intelligence
>
> Search and artificial intelligence products connect you with information and intelligently sense, process, and act on information—learning and adapting over time.
>
> ## Windows
>
> Windows is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access services, preferences, and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the Surface Hub. Rather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly, providing you with the latest improvements and features. In order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows. And because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it. Note that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your organization may use centralized management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data and to control device settings (including privacy settings), device policies, software updates, data collection by us or the organization, or other aspects of your device. Additionally, your organization may use management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data from that device, including your interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files. For more information about data collection and privacy in Windows, see Windows 10 and your online services. Earlier versions of Windows (including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1) are subject to their own privacy statements.
>
> ## Entertainment and related services
>
> Entertainment and Related Services power rich experiences and enable you to access a variety of content, applications and games.
