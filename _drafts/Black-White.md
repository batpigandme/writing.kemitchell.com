title: Freedom Was Never Enough
description: black-and-white ethics is willfully color-blind
---

Early open-source software stalwarts made the big stage by thumping hard on a single theme: freedom.  We're all born free to compute as we please, and computer programmers shouldn't try to stop us with "intellectual property".  But apart from a few zealots, almost nobody's real-world morality boils down to just "Can folks do what they wanna?"  What's right just ain't so black-and-white.

We care about those near to us.  We care about loyalty, respect, and fairness.  We care about connections to higher things and purposes.  We seek a balance of those concerns when they conflict with each other and with freedom, as we see they often do.

As more and people get involved, collaboratively and socially, in open source, values conflicts are flaring up all around them.  Software Freedom absolutism remains self-consciously black-and-white, while the world, as usual, appears defiantly in Technicolor.

## Horribles

Black-and-white software freedom encourages disregard, devaluation, and abuse of the people behind software.  We've seen developers browbeaten into slapping an MIT license on their work not for their benefit, but for the benefit of those beating brow.  We've seen bug reports demanding small features and fixes reek of entitlement â€¦ and nary a whiff of gratitude.

Black-and-white software freedom encourages firms to systematize reaping the moneymaking potential of projects they did not sow, even at the expense of their creators.  We've seen developers sacrifice to keep pace with a growing project, only to find themselves outcompeted by runaway incumbents wherever they turn for a buck: documentation, support, training, consulting, hosting, even swag.  We've seen those incumbents work, consciously and by natural selection, to trumpet the freedoms that play into the their advantages, limit the freedoms that level them, and expand the meaning of "open" to like effect.

Black-and-white software freedom enables powerful newcomers to undermine the leadership of long-serving creators and maintainers. We've seen developers booted from leadership positions by latecomers, marginalized and threatened by hostile forks from consortia of household names, and cloned by their pricey staff and consultants.  We've seen the notion of practical credit for one's work fall from respected license condition to broadly ignored chore to ["proprietary" mortal sin](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/27/osi_fury_badgerware/).

Black-and-white software freedom enables takers to turn makers' work against the very things they hold dear.  We've seen web tech turned into ad tech, computer vision into [surveillance](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/24/movidius-brings-its-computer-vision-tech-to-the-worlds-largest-security-camera-maker/), and cryptographic systems into [boiler-room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiler_room_(business)) [scams](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-219).  We've seen it all compiled, debugged, and deployed using copyleft tools that left us with nary a line of new source code.

When software-freedom absolutism manages to do some good in any of these other moral dimensions, the true believer happily credits to the cause.  But when software-freedom takes a toll of these types, the faithful blame the victim---You shouldn't have done open source like we told you to!---or simply write the damage off as acceptable collateral damage of freedom.

Black-and-white software freedom, like any black-and-white ethics, trades completeness and gritty realism for expedience and clean clarity.  As usual, that's a bum deal.  Just as computer programming often reduces a complex problem down to a computable approximation, inevitable errors be damned, ethical conversations trapped within software, which only step outside programming to grab vague positives like "freedom" and "community", derive a neatly computable ethics for a bad approximation of life.

The results in application often prove disastrous.  Just as software reductionism looses evil systems that looked good in the lab on the world, moral reductionism makes wanton moral automata of otherwise capable consciences, blinded or indifferent to meaningful consequences.  The comfort of sound theory, of easy certainty, must be preserved.  Morality _must_ be reduced to Turing-esque, deductive boolean reasoning, because the goal is to please those computing the answers, not those being computed on.

In American politics, we see a similarly pernicious interplay of values.  Those shocked or directly oppressed by abusive structures of authority, influence, and religion work out their frustrations by exclusive focus on justice and compassion, denying, more or less, that authority, influence, or religion has anything to offer anyone but their chosen few.  Others come to vilify a single, identifiable font of all worldly oppression, like the government, big business, communism, or capitalism.  All of those formative experiences are real, and all the lessons taken from them genuine, however objectively bunk their post-hoc rationalizations.  But the result is an unworkable politics of shouting extremes, at the expense of more holistic, humble, the-world-is-complicated approaches that don't fit any good-v-evil narrative.

Software is at best just a microcosm.  Early programmers felt oppressed and abused by [companies' use of nondisclosure agreements and copyright licenses](https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch01.html), and learned a knee-jerk liberty-liberalism by [Skinnerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning) experience.  They vilified, and made common cause with those who vilified, the single culprit of intellectual property law, symbolic source of all evil they abhorred.  RMS made a clever deal with that devil, for copyleft, but it worked out like deals with devils do, clever though they may be.

Now a new generation of programmers feels oppressed and abused _by companies' use of open source_.  They are learning a knee-jerk reflex against it, despite aspects they value very highly, aspects that often brought them into software in the first place.  They are learning that doing as open source orthodoxy prescribes, in the best case, can mean getting drawn between a growing project you just can't put down and an industry primed to scout, seize, and strip-mine all sustaining value from up-and-coming projects, leveraging teams, talent, brand recognition, and network effects indie devs can hardly hope to resist.  When developers protest, they learn that the blessed "ethical" option is to join the system as an employee, or else face down bully brigades of moral condemnation for having objected to the plainly wrong.

O'Reilly.  Red Hat.  Now Amazon.  Tomorrow some new billion-dollar network-effect lotto winner.  Not you.  You can at best form an also-ran, niche player that the reigning champion will be glad to cite as evidence that they are not, in fact, a monopoly.

People like me have to care about business models.  Nearly everyone I'm supposed to advise has to care about money.  I can answer their license questions all day, but the answers won't be any good if I ignore why the question's being asked in the first place.

The trick is finding models that:

1. Don't encourage bad or crippled work product.

   Any model that contends for nearly all developer time is out.

2. Work for single developers and small teams, as well as companies.

   Models that require teams of lawyers, salespeople, or separate open and closed developers are out.

3. Potentially make meaningful money for as many people.

   Swag doesn't cut it.

4. Don't leave them vulnerable to big incumbents with overwhelming structural advantages.

   Support and hosting are out, without proprietary code, infrastructure, or tooling, all crippled-product problems.

5. Don't produce the kinds of network effects that birth big incumbents with overwhelming structural advantages in the first place.

   Reproducing the problem is not a solution.

In simplified terms, we're looking for models that scale up, scale down, encourage good code, and send the money back where the code came from.  In value terms, we want _both_ free and fair, where free is the only paved path right now.

The original free software business model, payment for copies of software, was fair in free software's formative years.  RMS's nascent Free Software Foundation sold dead-tree manuals and copies of Emacs on tape, which as far as I can tell was all that held him back from going full anti-commerce right out of the gate.  But the same massive cost shift that made freedom matter so much and to so many---cheap Internet distribution---also gutted distribution as a meaningful moneymaker.  By then, FSF had won the donations-model lottery, and didn't much have to care.

As I have [mapped out systematically before](https://blog.licensezero.com/2018/10/17/mapping-models.html#purebred-models-overview), that leaves dual licensing (AKA selling exceptions, AKA public-private licensing) and [delayed release](https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry/), a species of dual licensing with some licensing choices preset by schedule.  All these models rely on the developer, their company, or [collaborative](https://xlcollaborative.com/) wielding unique power to ignore the terms of their own public license and offer others who can't different terms at a price.

From a broad, multifaceted moral perspective, that kind of unilateral power is resolutely positive.  The maker or makers of a project _are_ special with respect to their own work.  They deserve special power to reenforce the special bindings of maker to work and work to maker that we know in more general terms as "fairness", "authority", "merit", "credit" and so on---the missing moral dimensions of the stilted freedom-only view.  When someone other than the maker profits from their work at their expense, that's unfair.  And so forth.

But giving one developer or group---the one that happened to have made the software---special license frustrates those whose goal is to pick the fruits of those special connections to the work.  If you want to move in and outcompete the maker on paid distribution, you can't have them keeping distribution rights or build tooling to themselves.  So projects that do "aren't real open source", we're told, even with core code free for all to read and use.  If you want to outcompete the maker on support and maintenance services, you can't have them controlling access to documentation or gatekeeping governance.  So projects that do "aren't real open source", as we sometimes hear about Clojure, the foundation of a sprawling, healthy, [shockingly mature](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/) collaborative community.  If you want to outcompete the maker on hosting, you can't have them requiring you to release your proprietary hosting stack.  So projects that do "aren't real open source", as we heard about MongoDB's Server Side Public License.

I don't for a minute think that everyone who holds an extended or stringent view of "open source" schemes to screw maintainers.  There are other, valid reasons, moral and intellectual, to support each of those positions.  But reading history written by commercial winners, and bearing in mind their enormous powers of marketing, recruiting, and lobbying, it's no surprise that "open source" has been shifted, both as byproduct of corporate involvement and by direct, concerted political action, toward those views their singleton business models favor.  Permissive, not copyleft, and certainly not the [scary kind](https://paritylicense.com).  Not just code, but docs, guides, scripts, the kitchen sink, unless it's under NDA.  Not just a license, but governance, meetings, foundations, and codes of conduct, but HR-friendly ones, and nothing radical.  Enforcement, but [not the kind that bites](https://www.fsf.org/licensing/enforcement-principles), and [check your teeth at the door](https://gplcc.github.io/gplcc/).

Winners' history leaves us asking:  Was the moral foundation of free software, before open source coopted it, really so narrow?  I find that hard to believe.  But it's a question of purely historical significance now.  What open source will mean, and whether we will continue to pretend that it has innate moral character, as we once believed the Internet could only do good, is a question of the future and present experience, not the past.
