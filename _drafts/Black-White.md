<!-- Reaction to proprietary. Reaction to open source. -->

Software companies' restrictive licenses and secret source code threatened early hackers' sense of freedom, empowerment, and the revolutionary promise of computing machines.  So the truest believers launched a countermovement, originally known as free software, now best known as open source.

Today, open source claims widespread victory.  But software firms' use of open source licenses, methods, and software itself now threatens hackers' sense of contributing to a better world.  So a new generation of hackers is turning away away from the figureheads, foundations, firms, and faith tenets of open source.

Where are they going?

Some aim to reform of open source idealism out of hope that an even opener open source will solve its ills.  Some seek to revive free software ethics out of reverence for its purer, precommercial form.  But many have learned from experience that open-source ideology, free-software morality, and the conflicts between them aren't the question or the answer.  They're category error.  Making software open doesn't inevitably make it inevitably better.  Making software free doesn't turn release into an inherently moral act.

We want to feel good about software we use, software we make, how we make it, and who we make it with.  We need morality to tell us we're right, philosophy to connect them to a greater sense of purpose, and ideology to fill the gaps.  But good morality, philosophy, and ideology don't come from within software.  Good morality, philosophy, and ideology can't be that narrow-minded.

The tools and techniques of free and open source software aren't going anywhere.  But they are only that, tools.  The next great leaps in production and productivity won't take place along the old free-open ideological line.

We are learning that good software comes from focus on quality---as judged by its users---not as a byproduct of focus on any particular license or governance form or development style.  We are learning that a lasting sense of greater purpose comes from working with, and serving, users others than ourselves.  We are learning that a greater sense of right and wrong is a better sense of right and wrong.  That hackers must bring their morality and ideology from outside within it, rather than treating software as a moral or political island unto itself.  They can collaborate to improve their ethics, in addition to their code.

> When asking the question "When is it wrong (or right) to use closed-source software?", we should treat it the same way we treat every other ethical question.  First, by being very clear about what harmful consequences we wish to avoid; second, by reasoning from the avoidance of harm to a rule that is minimal and restricts peoples' choices as little as possible.

Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff.  When someone promises to make ethics simple, experience should make us all skeptical.  The would-be guru may be gaining more from the title of moral philosopher than they contribute to right living or good theory.

That, I fear, has been free and open source software ideology in my lifetime.  Its proponents donned ethical, philosophical, [even religious](https://stallman.org/saintignucius.jpg) vestments from very early on. But both honest analysis and lived experiment lay those pretensions bare.

Free and open source ideology oversimplifies hard ethical problems by reducing them to a single domain, software, and a single variable, software freedom.  We're all born free to compute as we please.  Neither computer programmers nor computer companies deserve to impinge.  If they uniformly didn't, life would be swell.  But almost no one's real-world morality boils down to "Can folks do what they wanna?"  What's right just isn't so black-and-white.  Especially when we step outside the niche of computing and consider costs and benefits from a broader point of view, the interplay of software and all the other parts of life.

## Appeal

I personally accepted delusions of ethical grandeur and loose use of weighty words like "philosophy" because they imbued my personal choices about software, well within my control, even in childhood, with outsize meaning and importance.  They enabled me to believe that my use of a form license, or even my taste in other peoples' software, amounted to countercultural, charitable, even revolutionary acts.  They did not.  Except in the view of others similarly seduced to self-aggrandizement.

A glancing comparison to nearly any other source of moral teaching available to me, secular or religious, would have shown how simplistic that line of thinking was.  Real moral philosophy remains messy, vague, frustrating, and humbling.  Real moral codes come riddled with exceptions, littered with factors to weigh and balance.  Software freedom asked little, delivered clarity, felt great, and promised empowerment.  Software freedom analysis boiled down to one long boolean `AND` proposition.

Too good to be true is easy to spot, unless it's too good to you.  Software freedom was very good to me.  It _felt_ better, even though it was worse.

I care for those near to me.  I value loyalty, respect, and fairness.  I cherish connections to higher meanings and purposes.  I seek a balance of those concerns and personal liberty when they conflict, as they often do.  As more people and companies get involved in open source, we see values conflict ever more often.

There's no slicing software off from the rest of life and solving it as a disjoint moral problem.  There's no more inherent good in any license or methodology or piece of software software than in the Internet or the English language or the free market.  If there is a morality in free software or open source, it's but a rote specialization of a broader, classically liberal ideology to software.  The more I probe that ideology, the more I find it has little appeal, in light of the problems of concern in my life.  Open source demonstrates its damnable shortcomings of that ideology, and its rote application to software, addition to its seductive strengths.

## Horribles

The path to this realization is well trodden, and increasingly well observed.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom encourage disregard, devaluation, and abuse of the people who make software.  I've seen developers browbeaten into slapping permissive licenses on their work not for their benefit, but for the benefit of those beating brow.  I've seen bug reports demanding features and fixes gush entitlement â€¦ and nary a drop of gratitude.

All of that is profoundly mean.  Maximizing freedom compromises kindness.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom birth successive generations of firms competing to reap projects they did not sow, at the expense of their creators.  I've seen developers sacrifice to keep pace with growing projects, only to be outdone by runaway incumbents wherever they turned for a buck: documentation, support, training, consulting, hosting, even swag.  I've seen those incumbents work, consciously and by Darwinian selection, to trumpet the freedoms that play to their advantages, elide the freedoms that level them, and expand the meaning of "open" to the same effect.

All of that is profoundly unfair.  Maximizing freedom compromises fairness.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom enable powerful newcomers to undermine the leadership of long-serving creators and maintainers. I've seen developers booted from leadership positions by latecomers, marginalized and threatened by hostile forks from consortia of household names, and cloned into obscurity by hirelings making bank while the original developers flail.  I've seen the norm of credit for good work fall from respected license condition to broadly ignored chore to ["proprietary" mortal sin](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/27/osi_fury_badgerware/).

All of this is profoundly disrespectful, and often disloyal.  Maximizing freedom compromises relationships and authority.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom enable takers to turn makers' work against the very things that inspired them in the first place.  I've seen web tech turned into ad tech, computer vision into [surveillance](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/24/movidius-brings-its-computer-vision-tech-to-the-worlds-largest-security-camera-maker/), and cryptographic systems into [boiler-room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiler_room_(business)) [scams](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-219).  I've seen it all compiled, debugged, and deployed using copyleft tools without a single new line of free source code to show for it.

All of this saps developers' sense of purpose.  Maximizing freedoms compromises purpose.

This is the interdependence of shared values in action.  When the only value we measure is freedom, freedom expands to fill all available space, choking out loyalty, respect, fairness, purpose, and basic human care.  Elevating any single value above all others brings consequences.  We are approaching a local maximum in freedom, and sinking everywhere else.

## Selectiveness

I [parade these horribles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_of_horribles) not to paint a one-sided picture of free or open software.  I've written many words on the positive effects that "open" writ large has had on my life and the lives of others, and still has.

The merits are well remarked, the troubles suspiciously less so.  Putting both on the table forces a choice:  Do we write off the troubles for the merits?  Do we ignore the merits in light of the troubles?  Or do we try to weigh and balance?  If we weigh and balance, how?

When software-freedom absolutism manages to do some good in any other dimension, the true believer happily credits freedom.  Given absolute freedom, they suppose all other goods would naturally follow.  But when software freedom takes a toll, the faithful blame the victim or write them off as acceptable collateral damage.  You shouldn't have done open source ... like we told you to.  You didn't do open the right way ... my way.  I have been guilty of all of these convenient criticisms.

Just as computer programming often reduces a complex problem down to a computable approximation for the sake of efficiency, ethical conversations trapped within software, which only step outside it to grab glittering generalities like "freedom" and "community", derive a neatly computable ethics for a bad approximation of life.  Just as software reductionism looses well-intentioned, predictably malign systems on the world, moral reductionism makes wanton moral automata of otherwise capable consciences, blinded or indifferent to predictable consequences.  When good theory starts from bad assumptions, applying that theory to the world, or forcing the world to fit it, takes causalities.

Trading completeness and gritty realism for expedience and clean clarity often means trading hard decisions and balanced outcomes for easy decisions and predictable mistakes.  The comfort of sound theory, of easy certainty, becomes the surest sign of truth, and therefore virtue.  Morality _must_ be reduced to Turing-esque, deductive, boolean reasoning---freedom or no freedom---because acclaim selects for those that please those computing the moral answers, not those subjected to the conclusions.

Until you realize you'll be subject to the decisions of others more often than they'll be subject to yours.

Until you face your interdependence, master of the software universe or not.

## Reactionary

We see this pattern in our politics, broadly.  Those shocked or oppressed by abusive structures of authority, loyalty, and religion go all-out for freedom, fairness, and kindness.  Exclusive focus on those values, in extreme form, denies, incredibly, that authority, loyalty, or religion has anything to offer anyone but their elects.  Others come to vilify a single, identifiable font of all affront to their dearest values, be it government, big business, "godless communism", or "late capitalism".

All those formative experiences come from life, and all the lessons taken from them reflect genuine living, however dubious their post-hoc rationalizations.  But the result of their no-common-denominator diversity is an unworkable politics of shouting extremes at the expense of more holistic, humble, the-world-is-complicated approaches with no clear good-versus-evil line, a lot more deliberation, but much less collateral damage.

Software is at best a microcosm.  Early free hackers felt oppressed and abused by [companies' use of nondisclosure agreements and copyright licenses](https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch01.html), which conditioned them to a reflexive libertarianism, at least within software.  They vilified corporations or intellectual property law, symbolic sources of the only affront consistently felt in their day-to-day: suppression of the growing, presumed-limitless, presumed-positive power of computing.  RMS made a clever deal with the copyright devil for copyleft, but it worked out like deals with the devil usually do.  ESR, a libertarian writ large, distilled software freedom rhetoric to even sharper terms, flipped the ideological color of its presentation, and sought to commercialize the concept, aided greatly by the lack of any deal with the devil to explain.

Now a new generation of programmers feels oppressed and abused _by commercial use of open source_, as a practice and a body of software.  Those experiences condition them to a knee-jerk reflex against open source, despite aspects they value very highly, aspects that may have brought them into software in the first place.  When they protest, they learn the blessed path is to join a pillar of the system they're protesting as an employee.  Those who refuse and continue to make noise face bully brigades of condemnation.  If [the Borg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg) had a social media team, it might feel like this.

The system has its acknowledged champions.  O'Reilly.  Red Hat.  Now Amazon.  Tomorrow perhaps a new network-effect lotto winner, which is unlikely to be you.  You can at best form an also-ran, niche player that the reigning champion will be glad to cite as evidence that they are not, in fact, a monopoly.  Your contributions are welcome, but your opinions on their moral use, and especially any attempts to enforce that morality as a precondition of contribution or a postcondition of use, are not.  Your labor, please, but not your opinion.
