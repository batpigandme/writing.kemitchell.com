Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff.  When a system promises to make ethical analysis simple, when it lacks nuance, that's a bright red flag.  It hints that the program may be gaining more from self-identifying as ethics or philosophy than it contributes to either, or just outcomes.

That, I fear, has been the case with free and open source software in my lifetime.  I'm no longer looking for a new software philosophy or a reformation of "true" software freedom.  I'm realizing that all of that is category error.  There is no ethics in software, any more than in law or knitting or the Web.  There is only people ethics, as applied to the things people do.

Early open-source software stalwarts made the big stage by thumping hard on a single theme: freedom.  We're all born free to compute as we please, and computer programmers shouldn't try to stop us with "intellectual property".  But apart from a few zealots, almost nobody's real-world morality boils down to just "Can folks do what they wanna?"  What's right just ain't so black-and-white, and what seems right looking just at software may not be right overall.

I accepted delusions of ethical grandeur and very loose use of heavy words like "philosophy" and "revolution" because they invested narrow personal choices about software, well within my control, with outsized meaning and importance.  I could tell by quick comparison with nearly any other source of moral teaching to which I'd been exposed how self-centered and simplistic software freedom was for a software person.  But real moral philosophy was messy, vague, and frustrating, while software freedom asked little and felt great.

I care about those near to me.  I care about loyalty, respect, and fairness.  I care about connections to higher things and purposes.  I seek a balance of those concerns when they conflict with each other and with freedom, as they very often do.  Extremism is ugly in all its forms.

As more and people get involved, collaboratively and socially, in open software, values conflicts flare up all around.  Software Freedom absolutism remains self-consciously black-and-white, while the world, as usual, presents in defiant Technicolor.

It's time to admit what I've long really known: There's no slicing software off from the rest of life and solving it as a disjoint moral problem.  There's no more inherent good in any particular software license or methodology than in the Internet or the English language.  If there is a moral philosophy in free software or open source, it's but a faithful application, a rote specialization, of a broader ideology to software.  The more I probe that higher source, the more I see an ideology of little use on the broader problems of personal concern in my life.

## Horribles

I've seen how black-and-white software freedom encourages disregard, devaluation, and abuse of the people who make software.  I've seen developers browbeaten into slapping MIT licenses on their work not for their benefit, but for the benefit of those beating brow.  I've seen bug reports demanding small features and fixes reek of entitlement â€¦ and nary a whiff of gratitude.

I've seen how black-and-white software freedom encourages firms to systematize reaping projects they did not sow at the expense of their creators.  I've seen developers sacrifice to keep pace with a growing project, only to find themselves outcompeted by runaway incumbents wherever they turned for a buck: documentation, support, training, consulting, hosting, even swag.  I've seen those incumbents work, consciously and by natural selection, to trumpet the freedoms that play to their advantages, limit the freedoms that level them, and expand the meaning of "open" to like effect.

I've seen how black-and-white software freedom enables powerful newcomers to undermine the leadership of long-serving creators and maintainers. I've seen developers booted from leadership positions by latecomers, marginalized and threatened by hostile forks from consortia of household names, and cloned by their pricey staff and consultants.  I've seen the notion of practical credit for one's work fall from respected license condition to broadly ignored chore to ["proprietary" mortal sin](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/27/osi_fury_badgerware/).

I've seen how black-and-white software freedom enables takers to turn makers' work against the very things they hold dear.  I've seen web tech turned into ad tech, computer vision into [surveillance](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/24/movidius-brings-its-computer-vision-tech-to-the-worlds-largest-security-camera-maker/), and cryptographic systems into [boiler-room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiler_room_(business)) [scams](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-219).  I've seen it all compiled, debugged, and deployed using copyleft tools with nary a line of new source code to show for it.

## Arbitrage

I don't offer this not as a complete picture of free or open software.  I've described elsewhere the positive effect that those phenomenon have had on my life, and have still.  But the merits are well remarked, the troubles less so.  Putting both on the table poses a choice:  Do we write off the troubles for the merits?  Do we ignore the merits in light of the troubles?  Or do we try to weigh and balance, and if so, by what means?

When software-freedom absolutism manages to do some good in any of these other moral dimensions, the true believer happily credits to the cause.  But when software-freedom takes a toll, the faithful blame the victim---You shouldn't have done open source like we told you to!  You didn't do it pure enough!---or simply write the damage off as acceptable collateral damage of freedom.  I've been guilty both ways.

Black-and-white software freedom, like any black-and-white ethics, trades completeness and gritty realism for expedience and clean clarity.  As usual, that's a bum deal.  Just as computer programming often reduces a complex problem down to a computable approximation, inevitable errors be damned, ethical conversations trapped within software, which only step outside the practice to grab vague positives like "freedom" and "community", derive a neatly computable ethics for a bad approximation of life.

The results court disaster in real-world application.  Just as software reductionism looses evil systems that looked good in theory on the world, moral reductionism makes wanton moral automata of otherwise capable consciences, blinded or indifferent to meaningful consequences.  The comfort of sound theory, of easy certainty, becomes the prime directive.  Morality _must_ be reduced to Turing-esque, deductive boolean reasoning, because the selection criterion is pleasing those computing the moral answers, not those being computed on.

This isn't balancing.  It's picking one side from the start---the good---and discounting all contrary evidence.

## The Usual

In American politics, we see a similarly pernicious alchemy of values.

Those shocked or directly oppressed by abusive structures of authority, influence, and religion work out their frustrations by exclusive focus on justice and compassion, denying, more or less, that authority, influence, or religion has anything to offer anyone but their chosen few.  Others come to vilify a single, identifiable font of all worldly injustice of their pet kind, be it government, big business, "godless communism", or "late capitalism".

All of those formative experiences are real, and all the lessons taken from them genuine, however objectively bunk their post-hoc rationalizations.  But the result of their diversity is an unworkable politics of shouting extremes, at the expense of more holistic, humble, the-world-is-complicated approaches with no clear good-v-evil line.

Software is at best a microcosm.  Early programmers felt oppressed and abused by [companies' use of nondisclosure agreements and copyright licenses](https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch01.html), and learned a knee-jerk liberty-liberalism by quasi-[Skinnerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning) conditioning.  They vilified, and made common cause with those who vilified, the single culprit of intellectual property law, symbolic source of all evil they abhorred, the suppression of the growing, limitless power of computing in our lives.  RMS made a clever deal with that devil, for copyleft, but it worked out like deals with devils typically do, clever though they may be.

Now a new generation of programmers feels oppressed and abused _by commercial use of open source_.  They are learning a knee-jerk reflex against it, despite aspects they value very highly, aspects that often brought them into software in the first place.  They are learning that doing as open source orthodoxy prescribes, in the best case, can mean getting drawn between a growing project you just can't put down and an industry primed to scout, seize, and strip all sustaining value from up-and-coming projects, leveraging teams, talent, brand recognition, and network effects indie devs can hardly hope to resist.

When developers protest, they learn that the blessed "ethical" option is to join the system as an employee, or else face down bully brigades of condemnation for having objected to what seems plainly wrong.  If the Borg had a social media team, it might feel like this.

O'Reilly.  Red Hat.  Now Amazon.  Tomorrow some new network-effect lotto winner.  Not you.  You can at best form an also-ran, niche player that the reigning champion will be glad to have as evidence that they are not, in fact, a monopoly.

## Money

I have occasionally met lawyers who seemed to have taken a wrong turn at B school.  They somehow wound up in law school instead.  Not I.  Never have I wanted a business education, because frankly, even the books make me choke.

But people like me have to care about business models.  Nearly everyone I'm supposed to advise has to care about money, though they'd rather not.  I can answer their license questions all day, but the answers won't be any good if I ignore why they're asking in the first place.

The trick is finding models that:

1. Don't encourage bad or crippled work product.

   Any model that contends for most developer time is out.

2. Work for single developers and small teams, as well as companies.

   Models that require teams of lawyers, salespeople, or separate open and closed development teams are out.

3. Potentially make meaningful money for as many people.

   Swag doesn't cut it.

4. Don't leave them vulnerable to big incumbents with overwhelming structural advantages.

   Support and hosting are out, without proprietary code, infrastructure, or tooling, all crippled-product problems.

5. Don't produce the kinds of network effects that birth big incumbents with overwhelming structural advantages in the first place.

   Reproducing the problem is not a solution.

In simplified terms, my people look for models that scale up, scale down, encourage good code, and send the money back where the code came from.  In value terms, they want _both_ free and fair, where free is the only paved path so far.

## Elimination

The original free software business model, payment for copies of software, was fair in free software's formative years.  RMS's nascent Free Software Foundation sold dead-tree manuals and copies of Emacs on tape, which as far as I can tell was all that held him back from full anti-commerce out of the gate.  But the same massive cost shift that made freedom matter so much and to so many---the Internet---also gutted distribution as a meaningful moneymaker.  By then, FSF had won the donations-model lottery, and didn't much have to care.

As I have [mapped out systematically before](https://blog.licensezero.com/2018/10/17/mapping-models.html#purebred-models-overview), that leaves [public-private licensing](https://indieopensource.com/public-private/indies) (AKA dual licensing AKA selling exceptions) and [delayed release](https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry/), a species of dual licensing with some licensing choices preset by schedule.  All these models rely on the developer, a company, or [another vehicle](https://xlcollaborative.com/) wielding unique power to ignore the terms of the public license for the code and to offer others who don't have that superpower different terms for a price.

From a broad, multifaceted moral perspective, that kind of unilateral power nets out very positive.  The maker or makers of a project _are_ morally special with respect to their own work.  They deserve leverage to reinforce the connection between maker and work that we know in moral terms like "fairness", "authority", "merit", "credit" and so on---the missing moral dimensions of the stilted freedom-only view.  When someone other than the maker profits from their work at their expense, that's wrong.  When project leadership gets run over roughshod by self-serving newcomers, that's wrong.  When resources rather than track record drive development, that's wrong.  When forks and clones steal the limelight of hard-won ideas and innovations, that's wrong.

So we give the dev some leverage.  Because not everyone notices or cares about wrongdoing.

## Competitive Lexicography

Giving the developer or group that happened to make the software special powers frustrates those whose goal is to pick the fruits of the work, which unlike the software, may be quite scarce and rivalrous.

If you want to move in and outcompete the maker on paid distribution, you can't have them keeping distribution rights or build tooling to themselves.  So projects that do "aren't real open source" even with core code free for all to read and use.

If you want to outcompete the maker on support and maintenance services, you can't have them controlling access to documentation or gatekeeping governance.  So projects that do "aren't real open source", as we sometimes hear about Clojure, the foundation of a sprawling, healthy, [shockingly mature](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/) collaborative effort.

If you want to outcompete the maker on hosting, you can't have them requiring you to release your proprietary hosting stack.  So projects that do "aren't real open source", as we heard about MongoDB's Server Side Public License.

I don't for a minute think that everyone who holds an extended or exclusionary view of "open source" schemes to screw devs.  There are other, valid reasons, moral and intellectual, to support each of those positions.  But reading history written by commercial stalwarts, and bearing in mind their enormous powers of marketing, recruiting, and lobbying, it's no surprise that "open source" has shifted, both as byproduct of corporate involvement and by direct, concerted political action, toward those views that singleton representatives of successive business-model innovations favor.

Permissive, not copyleft, and certainly not the [scary kind](https://paritylicense.com).  Not just code, but docs, guides, and scripts, too, but not on terms we don't like.  Not just a license, but governance, meetings, foundations, and codes of conduct, but HR-friendly ones, and nothing radical.  Enforcement, but [not the kind that hurts](https://www.fsf.org/licensing/enforcement-principles), and [surrender your weapons at the door](https://gplcc.github.io/gplcc/).

Winners' history leaves me asking:  Was the moral foundation of free software, before open source coopted it, really so narrow?  I find that hard to believe.  But it's a question of purely historical significance now.  What open source will mean, and whether we will continue to pretend that it has innate moral character, as we once believed the Internet could only do good, is a question of the future and present experience, not the past.
