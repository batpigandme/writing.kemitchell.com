Software companies' restrictive licenses and secret source code threatened early hackers' sense of freedom and empowerment.  So the truest believers launched a counterattack now known as open source.  Today, software firms' use of open source licenses, methods, and software threatens hackers' sense of contributing to a better world.  A new generation of hackers is turning away away from the figureheads, foundations, firms, and faith of open source.

It's not a reform of open source idealism out of hope that an even opener open source would solve their problems.  It's not a revival of free software ethics out of reverence for its purer, pre-commercial form.  Hackers have learned from experience that open-source ideology, free-software morality, and the conflicts between them aren't the question or the answer.  They're category error.

We want to feel good about software we use, software we make, how we make it, and who we make it with.  We need philosophy to connect us to greater purposes, morality to guide our actions, and ideology to fill the gaps.  But good philosophy, morality, and ideology don't come from software.  When they do, they're dangerously simplistic, problematically incomplete, and just not very good.

## Simplicity

Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff.  When someone promises to make ethics simple, real-life experience should make us all skeptical.  The would-be guru may be gaining more from the title of "moral philosopher" than they contribute to workable justice.

That, I fear, has been free and open source software ideology in my lifetime.  Its writers donned ethical, philosophical, and even religious vestments from early on. But both honest analysis and lived experiment lay those pretensions bare.

Free and open source ideology oversimplifies hard ethical problems by reducing them to a single variable, freedom.  We're all born free to compute as we please, and neither computer programmers nor computer companies deserve to impinge.  But almost no one's real-world morality boils down to just "Can folks do what they wanna?"  What's right just isn't so black-and-white.  Especially when you step out of your own niche---computing---and consider costs and benefits from a broader point of view.

## Appeal

I personally accepted delusions of ethical grandeur and loose use of weighty words like "philosophy" because they imbued my personal choices about software, well within my control, even in childhood, with outsize meaning and importance.  They enabled me to believe that my use of a form license, or even my taste in other peoples' software, amounted to countercultural, charitable, even revolutionary acts.  They did not.

A glancing comparison to nearly any other source of moral teaching available to me, secular or religious, would have shown how self-aggrandizing and simplistic that line of thinking was.  Real moral philosophy remains messy, vague, frustrating, and humbling.  Real moral codes come riddled with exceptions, littered with factors to weigh and to balance.  Software freedom asked little, delivered clarity, felt great, and promised empowerment.  Software freedom boiled down to one boolean `AND` proposition.

Too good to be true is easy to spot, unless it's good for you.  Software freedom was very good for me.  It _felt_ better, even though it was worse.

I care for those near to me.  I value loyalty, respect, and fairness.  I cherish connections to higher things and purposes.  I seek a balance of those concerns and freedom when they conflict, as they often do.  As more people and companies get involved in open source, we see values conflict ever more often.

There's no slicing software off from the rest of life and solving it as a disjoint moral problem.  There's no more inherent good in any license or methodology or piece of software software than in the Internet or the English language or a free market.  If there is an inherent morality in free software or open source, it's but a rote specialization of a broader ideology to software.  The more I probe that ideology, the more I find it has little bearing on the broader problems of personal concern in my life.  Open source demonstrates its shortcomings as well as its seductive strengths.

## Horribles

The path to this realization is well trodden, and increasingly well observed.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom encourage disregard, devaluation, and abuse of the people who make software.  I've seen developers browbeaten into slapping permissive licenses on their work not for their benefit, but for the benefit of those beating brow.  I've seen bug reports demanding features and fixes gush entitlement â€¦ and nary a drop of gratitude.

All of that is profoundly mean.  Maximizing freedom compromises kindness.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom birth successive generations of firms competing to reap projects they did not sow, at the expense of their creators.  I've seen developers sacrifice to keep pace with growing projects, only to be outdone by runaway incumbents wherever they turned for a buck: documentation, support, training, consulting, hosting, even swag.  I've seen those incumbents work, consciously and by Darwinian selection, to trumpet the freedoms that play to their advantages, elide the freedoms that level them, and expand the meaning of "open" to the same effect.

All of that is profoundly unfair.  Maximizing freedom compromises fairness.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom enable powerful newcomers to undermine the leadership of long-serving creators and maintainers. I've seen developers booted from leadership positions by latecomers, marginalized and threatened by hostile forks from consortia of household names, and cloned into obscurity by hirelings making bank while the original developers flail.  I've seen the norm of credit for good work fall from respected license condition to broadly ignored chore to ["proprietary" mortal sin](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/27/osi_fury_badgerware/).

All of this is profoundly disrespectful, and often disloyal.  Maximizing freedom compromises relationships and authority.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom enable takers to turn makers' work against the very things that inspired them in the first place.  I've seen web tech turned into ad tech, computer vision into [surveillance](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/24/movidius-brings-its-computer-vision-tech-to-the-worlds-largest-security-camera-maker/), and cryptographic systems into [boiler-room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiler_room_(business)) [scams](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-219).  I've seen it all compiled, debugged, and deployed using copyleft tools without a single new line of free source code to show for it.

All of this saps developers' sense of purpose.  Maximizing freedoms compromises purpose.

This is the interdependence of shared values in action.  When the only value we measure is freedom, freedom expands to fill all available space, choking out loyalty, respect, fairness, purpose, and basic human care.  Elevating any single value above all others brings consequences.  We are approaching a local maximum in freedom, and sinking everywhere else.

## Selectiveness

I [parade these horribles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_of_horribles) not to paint a one-sided picture of free or open software.  I've remarked countless times on the positive effect that "open" writ large has had on my life, and still has.  The merits are well remarked, the troubles suspiciously less so.  Putting both on the table forces a choice:  Do we write off the troubles for the merits?  Do we ignore the merits in light of the troubles?  Or do we try to weigh and balance?  If we weigh and balance, how?

When software-freedom absolutism manages to do some good in any other dimension, the true believer happily credits freedom.  For the truest believer, given absolute freedom, all other goods will come naturally, as consequences.  But when software freedom takes a toll, the faithful blame the victim or write them off as acceptable collateral damage.  You shouldn't have done open source ... like we told you to.  You didn't do open the right way ... my way.  I have been guilty of all of this.

Just as computer programming often reduces a complex problem down to a computable approximation, for the sake of efficiency, ethical conversations trapped within software, which only step outside it to grab vague generalities like "freedom" and "community", derive a neatly computable ethics for a bad approximation of life.  Just as software reductionism looses well-intentioned, predictably malign systems on the world, moral reductionism makes wanton moral automata of otherwise capable consciences, blinded or indifferent to predictable consequences.  When good theory starts from bad assumptions, applying that theory to the world, or changing the world to fit it, creates causalities.

Trading completeness and gritty realism for expedience and clean clarity often means trading hard decisions and good outcomes for easy decision and predictable mistakes.  The comfort of sound theory, of easy certainty, becomes the surest sign of truth, and therefore virtue.  Morality _must_ be reduced to Turing-esque, deductive boolean reasoning, because acclaim selects for those that please those computing the moral answers, not those subjected to the conclusions.

Until you realize you'll be subject to the decisions of others more often than they'll be subject to yours.  Until you face your interdependence.

## Reactionary

We see a common pattern in our politics, broadly.  Those shocked or directly oppressed by abusive structures of authority, influence, and religion work out their frustrations through justice and compassion advocacy.  That focus, in extreme form, risks denying that authority, influence, or religion has anything to offer anyone but their elects.  Others come to vilify a single, identifiable font of all worldly injustice, be it government, big business, "godless communism", or "late capitalism".

All those formative experiences come from them, and all the lessons taken from reflect genuine lessons, however dubious their post-hoc rationalizations.  But the result of their no-common-denominator diversity is an unworkable politics of shouting extremes at the expense of more holistic, humble, the-world-is-complicated approaches with no clear good-versus-evil line, but much less collateral damage.

Software is at best a microcosm.  Early free hackers felt oppressed and abused by [companies' use of nondisclosure agreements and copyright licenses](https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch01.html), which conditioned them to a knee-jerk libertarianism.  They vilified, and made common cause with those who vilified, corporations or intellectual property law, symbolic sources of the only evil consistently seen in their day-to-day: suppression of the growing, presumed-limitless, presumed-positive power of computing.  RMS made a clever deal with the intellectual property devil for copyleft, but it worked out like deals with the devil usually do.

Now a new generation of programmers feels oppressed and abused _by commercial use of open source_, as a practice and a body of software.  Those experiences condition them to a knee-jerk reflex against open source, despite aspects they value very highly, aspects that may have brought them into software in the first place.  In their own work, they are learning that doing as open source orthodoxy prescribes, in the best case, can mean getting drawn between a growing project you just can't put down and an industry primed to scout, seize, and strip all sustaining value from up-and-comers.

When developers protest, they learn the blessed "ethical" path is to join the system as an employee.  They beat you, so join 'em.  If you refuse, and lash out publicly, you'll face bully brigades of condemnation for objecting to what seemed plainly wrong.  If the Borg had a social media team, it might feel like this.

The system has its acknowledged champions.  O'Reilly.  Red Hat.  Now Amazon.  Tomorrow some new network-effect lotto winner.  Not you.  You can at best form an also-ran, niche player that the reigning champion will be glad to cite as evidence that they are not, in fact, a monopoly crushing all comers.

## Money

I have occasionally met lawyers who seemed to have taken a wrong turn at B School, and wound up in law school by mistake.  Not I.  I've never coveted a business education, because frankly, I can't read the books without my eyes rolling, and I'm afraid they'll get stuck that way.

But people like me have to care about business models.  Nearly everyone I'm supposed to advise has to care about money, though they'd rather not.  I can answer their license questions all day, but the answers won't be any good if I ignore why they're asking in the first place.

The trick is finding models that:

1. Don't encourage bad or crippled work product.

   Any model that contends for most developer time is out.

2. Don't sap the motivation of contributors.

   Any model that makes bank by selling out on core values is out.

3. Work for single developers and small teams, as well as companies.

   Models that require teams of lawyers, salespeople, or separate open and closed development teams are out.

4. Potentially make meaningful money for as many people.

   Swag doesn't cut it.

5. Don't leave them vulnerable to big incumbents with overwhelming structural advantages.

   Support and hosting are out, without proprietary code, infrastructure, or tooling, all crippled-product problems.

6. Don't produce the kinds of network effects that birth big incumbents with overwhelming structural advantages in the first place.

   Reproducing the problem is not a solution.

In simplified terms, my people look for models that scale up, scale down, encourage good code, and send the money back where the code came from.  In value terms, they want free, but also fair more broadly, where free is the only path paved so far.

## Elimination

The original free software business model, payment for copies of software, was broadly fair in free software's formative years.  RMS's nascent Free Software Foundation sold [dead-tree manuals and copies of Emacs on tape](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~trent/gnu/bull/16/gnu_bulletin_28.html), which as far as I can tell was all that held him back from full anti-commerce out of the gate.  But the same massive cost shift that made freedom seem crushingly important, the Internet, also gutted distribution as a meaningful moneymaker.  But by then FSF had won the attention-donations lottery, and didn't much have to care.

As I have [mapped out systematically before](https://blog.licensezero.com/2018/10/17/mapping-models.html#purebred-models-overview), that leaves [public-private licensing](https://indieopensource.com/public-private/indies) (AKA dual licensing AKA selling exceptions) and [delayed release](https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry/), a species of dual licensing with some licensing choices preset by schedule.  All these models rely on the developer, a company, or [another vehicle](https://xlcollaborative.com/) wielding unique power to ignore the terms of the public license for the code and offer others different terms for a price.

From a broad, multifaceted moral perspective, that kind of unilateral power makes perfect sense.  The maker of a project _is_ morally special with respect to their own work.  When someone other than the maker knowingly profits from their work at their expense, that's wrong.  When project leadership gets run over roughshod by self-serving newcomers, that's wrong.  When resources rather than track record drive development, that's wrong.  When forks and clones steal the limelight of hard-won ideas and innovations, that's wrong.  Unless freedom is all that determines right and wrong.  Creators' unique licensing powers provide leverage against all those wrongs---the missing moral dimensions of the freedom-blinkered view.

## Competitive Lexicography

Giving the developer or group that happened to make the software special powers frustrates those whose goal is to pick the fruits of the work.  The fruits, unlike the software, may be quite scarce and rivalrous.

If you want to move in and outcompete the maker on paid distribution, you can't have them keeping distribution rights or build tooling to themselves.  So projects that do "aren't real open source" even with core code stands free for all to read and use.

If you want to outcompete the maker on support or maintenance services, you can't have them controlling access to documentation or gatekeeping governance.  So projects that do "aren't real open source", as we sometimes hear about Clojure, the foundation of a sprawling, healthy, [shockingly mature](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/) collaborative effort.

If you want to outcompete the maker on hosting, you can't have them requiring you to release your proprietary hosting stack and tooling.  So projects that do "aren't real open source", as we heard about MongoDB's Server Side Public License.

I don't for a minute think that everyone who holds an extended or exclusionary view of "open source" schemes to screw open devs.  There are other, valid reasons to support each of those positions.  But reading history written by commercial stalwarts, and bearing in mind their enormous powers of marketing, recruiting, and lobbying, it's no surprise that "open source" has shifted toward those views that singleton champions of successive open-business-model innovations favor, both as byproduct of corporate involvement and by direct, concerted political action.

Permissive, not copyleft, and certainly not the [scary kind](https://paritylicense.com).  Not just code, but docs, guides, and scripts, too, but not on terms we don't like.  Not just a license, but governance, meetings, foundations, and codes of conduct, but HR-friendly ones, and nothing radical.  Enforcement, but [not the kind that hurts](https://www.fsf.org/licensing/enforcement-principles), and [surrender any weapons you may have](https://gplcc.github.io/gplcc/).
