When I was a boy, open source Linux distributions were the fastest, easiest way to get new software, period.  If you read about a program that excited you, and it turned out that program was open source, you could `sudo apt-get install $thing`, run `$thing`, and try it out.  `sudo apt-get upgrade` brought all the goodies up-to-date.

Outside the open source world, trying a new program meant finding a place to download the right version, downloading an installer program or package, installing, and running.  Assuming the program was free to begin with.  Assuming the program was available online, and not just in stores.  In any case, each program came with its own update system, or none at all.  Boxed software routinely shipped with patches on extra media tossed inside.

Comparing yesterday's `sudo apt-get` with today's smartphone app stores, it's clear the app stores have beaten open source on discovery and installation.  Some arguably leapfrog it on updates, too.

But if not for its shortcomings in other areas, all these systems would be at best distant second to the Web.  As a rule, you don't install things on today's Web.  You sign onto them, and perhaps log in.  And you don't upgrade things on the Web.  They get upgraded for you.
