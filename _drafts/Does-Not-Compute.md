I read RedMonk's blog, and it's worth reading.  Stephen O'Grady's [_The Cyclical Theory of Open Source_](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2018/12/21/cycles-oss/) is worth reading.  But not because Stephen is right.  Rather, Stephen's thoughtful analysis exemplifies, better than any piece I've seen, how an old school of thought, characteristics of many early open source advocates turned consultants, hits a wall with the new licensing experiments.

Stephen himself lays out the major symptoms.  Having quite literally enumerated reasons experiments like MongoDB's Server Side Public License and Commons Clause should and must fail, Stephen admits:

> Whatever the relative merits or downsides to these new licenses, however, the market does appear to be shifting...

Mindset and market conflict.  Market prevails.  And no measure of fear, uncertainty, and doubt will turn the market around.  Not to stop open source, as it rose.  Not to stop source-available and radical copyleft licensing, now ascendant.

What is going on?

## Open Source is Not the Public Interest

The free software movement, and in particular its renegade "open source" marketing fraction, won in the sense of "open source won" by serving private interests, not the public interest.  Software developers releasing source code under generous public license have assuredly served both.  But the widespread adoption and production of open source tracks increasing recognition of open source's value to industry, not 

or delivery of value direct to common causes.

Uniformity and Discipline

Directed Evolution

## Definition is Defense

## Fear and Uncertainty Doubtful

## Community, if Market Wants It

## Standardization Serves us All
