There's a lot of concern these days about financial support for open source software.  Who will pay for accomplished developers to make software that nobody pays for?

Fortunately, there's an answer:  Angel investors will pay for it.

***WARNING: Running the following plan cynically is probably fraud.  Do not commit fraud.***  I've got something better for you, later.  And also for the angels.

The dark-side plan looks like this:

1.  Hock your open-source project as a start-up business.  Don't fret revenue.  Emphasize the chance you'll be acquired for [nebulous, strategic reasons](https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/), for cash or public-company stock.

2.  Raise as much money as you can on founder-friendly terms with no corporate-control or imminent-death financial ramifications.  In other words, on [SAFEs](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/#safe).

3.  Use the money to pay salaries and benefits for yourself and fellow contributors.  Stretch it out.

4.  Amass reputation and experience in public work.  Release everything under the permissive open source terms _you_ would want for the project, like [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

5.  If you're not acquired for gobs, and money runs out, shut the company down and move on.  Keep your reputation, experience, and even your code, which your former company now licenses to you or your new employer on the terms you yourself picked.

If you've managed to run this plan despite yourself, congratulations.  You are not alone.

If you've managed to run this plan intentionally, you're the problem.  Enjoy this blog post.

If you've managed to fund this plan, I'd ask you not to do so again.  I love open source software, and I want it to succeed.  This is not success.  Success is when you win, too, and want to fund a winning play again.

## Hail, SAFE!

In ye olden days, early-stage startup companies raised money using agreements called _convertible notes_.  These were essentially small-business loans that defined success in terms of raising money from more demanding venture capitalists, instead of profit. 

If the debtor-company managed to raise money from VCs, the amount invested on the note would transform into the same kind of preferred stock the VCs bought in the financing, rather than cash.  Hence _convertible_.  Conversely, if the company stayed in business for a set term of years, but never raised VC, the notes came due like a loan.  The company had to pay out in cash, with interest.  Hence _note_.  In a nutshell, the convertible note bound the company either to raise venture capital, or to buy make enough money on its own to buy the note investor out.

The SAFE, promulgated by Y Combinator, a leading startup accelerator program, changed that norm.  Riding promises to be neither voting stock nor equity, the SAFE swept the land as the easy, standardized, early-money investment vehicle of choice.

More critically, SAFEs reflected inflated startup leverage, and boil down to absurdly founder-friendly convertible notes.  Most notably, if a company doesn't raise venture capital or achieve an "exit", it doesn't owe SAFE investors anything, until it folds, at which point there's no money to pay out.  SAFE money invested becomes, essentially, a free financial booster.  There's no effective commitment to go the VC-backed startup route.

Plenty of companies set out on the startup path, and find themselves holding down a more traditional small-business line, or simply running out of cash.  Some of those companies make open source professionally, which costs, but doesn't pay.  That's a privilege above the financial rank of a startup, afforded by a shot of outside capital.

## Escape Hatch

Founding, funding, and failing a Silicon-Valley-style startup is in many ways its own reward.  There is a certain tolerance and even celebration of failure among entrepreneur-types.  But this was about open source.

The trouble with a no-real-strings-attached open source startup is much the same as with paid open source work.  Working in the open, on open source, creates all kinds of positive externalities for the individuals involved.  Externalities the company itself, if it's small, and especially if it's _controlled by the open source developers_, can't or won't attempt to capture.

In this day and age, development tends to happen via personal accounts, on GitHub and even on distribution systems, like npm.  Conversations spill out onto IRC, Twitter, and other channels.  Personal identity is primary.  Corporate affiliation is secondary, and often temporary.

But of course it needn't stop there.  Marketing expenditures raise the profile not only of the company and its product, but those contributing in their own names.  Conference and trade show attendance yields name recognition and networking.  Some of these benefits are standard to in-house coders, as well.  But the overall package is rich.

There are offsetting problems.  Dealing with a user community, without HR support or work professionalism standards, over gamified social media platforms across time zones, works developers over pretty hard.  Not many last more than a few years, but that's about par for a startup gig, in any event.

The coup is the code.  In a traditional startup, all the intellectual property from founders, employees, and contractors goes into one big hat called the company.  Founders and funders buy shares in the hat, interests in the business opportunity it creates.

With open source, especially permissive open source under licenses like MIT, BSD, and Apache, the hat has a hole in the bottom, and code falls out.  Corporations frequently develop software under such terms as loss-leaders.  But with no financial accountability, founders can make every decision to maximize adoption of their software, maximizing their personal externalities.  They can nurse the delusion that blockbuster adoption success, at a price of zero dollars, will inevitably breed dollar-making opportunity, and that their company will be best positioned to seize that opportunity.

It doesn't work like that.  If it doesn't work long enough, the company will fold.  But when the company folds, any number of developers---at other companies, at competitor companies, the _departed startup founders themselves_---receive the public open source license the company granted while it lived.  It can be very difficult to revoke those license, legally.  Often, the liquidation potential just isn't worth it, and copyright in the code ends up in a kind of legal purgatory.  Nobody really knows who owns the code, legally.  But it doesn't matter, since the open source license gives all their exclusive rights in the code away to everybody else.

## Damn Shame

The shame in all of this, on both the founder side and the investor side, is that open source at a startup doesn't have to mean failure.  There are plenty-good business models for open source, both for early stages, and to grow into.  There's a lot of work to be done, trying out new models and variations, and figuring out what works.

Dual-license under a strong-copyleft license.  Build a "closed shell" around an existing, permissively licensed open core.  Start source-available, and transition to open source once you've done enough market research to launch a new paid offering.  Sell hosting, and run hyper-lean.

Generally, open source is a financial handicap.  By giving the ability to use your software away for free, you forgo the means of compensation best aligned with value delivered.  But some business plays, peculiar to the kind of software involved, the other practical or regulatory requirements entailed, or the state of the preexisting market, make the play rational.  It needs to feel like a coincidence: open source distribution solves the system of equations evident in your market.  No points for forcing open source onto your customer base, because you want to do open source first, and a business takes customers.
