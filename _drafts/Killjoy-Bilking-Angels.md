There's a lot of concern these days about financial support for open source software.  Who will pay for accomplished developers to make open source that nobody pays for?  What will open source look like once students and moonlighters realize there's no financial case past a certain point, and only paid contributors, greenhorns, and fools are left?

Fortunately, there's an easy answer:  Would-be angel investors will pay experienced hands to make open source.  The plan looks like this:

1. Hock your open-source project as a start-up business.  Don't fret revenue.  Emphasize the chance you'll be acquired for nebulous, strategic reasons, for cash or public-company stock.
2. Raise as much money as you can on absurdly founder-friendly terms with no corporate-control or financial ramifications.  In other words, on SAFEs.
3. Use the money to pay salaries and benefits for yourself and fellow contributors.  Stretch it out.
4. Amass reputation and experience from work.  Spend some of the money on marketing.  Release everything you make under permissive open source terms.
5. If you're not acquired for gobs of cash, and money runs out, shut the company down and move on.  Keep your reputation, experience, and even your code.

You will not be the first.

## Hail, SAFE!

In ye olden days, early-stage startup companies raised early-stage money using agreements called _convertible notes_.  These were essentially small-business loans that defined success in terms of raising money from more demanding venture capitalists, instead of profit.  If the debtor-company managed to raise money from VCs, the amount invested on the note would transform into the same kind of preferred stock the VCs bought in the financing, rather than cash.  The company would have to pay cash back only if it didn't raise from VCs within a set term of years.

The SAFE, promulgated by Y Combinator, a leading startup accelerator program, changed that norm.  Riding promises to be neither voting stock nor equity, legally speaking, the SAFE swept the land as the easy, standardized, early-money investment vehicle of choice. 

More cynically, SAFEs reflected inflated startup valuations, and boil down to absurdly founder-friendly convertible notes.  Most notably, if a company doesn't raise venture capital or achieve an "exit", it doesn't owe SAFE investors anything, at any time.  SAFE money invested becomes, essentially, free money, if there's anything left of it.  The company has to pay out if it goes bust, but at that point, there usually isn't any money, anyway.

The SAFE understands but three outcomes: financing, exit, and dissolution.  But a small business---disparagingly, a "lifestyle business"---undergoes none of those ordeals.  Operating on its own earnings, neither failing nor taking further investment, the small business triggers none of the SAFE requirements to convert or pay investors.  The money that went in does not go out.

Telling investors you intend to sell to a big, public company or go public when you don't is securities fraud.  Do not commit securities fraud.  But plenty of companies set out on the startup path, and find themselves holding down a more traditional small-business line, or simply running out of cash.
