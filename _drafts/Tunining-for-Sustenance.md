Part of making open source software more welcoming to new
folks is making more and more of new folks' choices for
them.  Those of us in positions to make choices for others
should be very, very careful which choices we take away, how
we resolve them, and what we leave behind, to be reevaluated
later.  Fundamentally, we're social engineering at large
scale, well intentioned or not.  Wisdom starts to look like
hard trade-offs and self-doubt, most of the time.  Certainty
becomes a warning sign.  What we get wrong won't be so easy
to fix, further on down the line.

When I look at the defaults we're setting for open source
these days, as a whole, I see great cause for concern.  I'd
be hard pressed to name a single contribution to the overall
picture that stands out as anything but abidingly well
intentioned.  But in the aggregate, I see us entrenching and
exacerbating known problems.  Problems we're less confident
we can solve.  Problems that hurt some part of our
community, and advantage others, in their unsolved states.

I have been my own small part of the problem.  I'd like to
talk about the problem.  And I'd like to show some of the
work behind the small choices I've made with larger
implications.  Some of the work behind what I'm doing now.

Let me be clear.  My concern is with the aggregate effect of
well intentioned and well considered choices.  As a
beginner, if instead of making a choice I don't really
understand, I get a sane default made or compellingly
suggested for me, I'm that much more likely to find my feet
and start walking in software.

Making hard choices easier makes open source more
accessible.  Hiding error-prone complexity from those liable
to trip and fall is progress.  `npm init --yes` gets you The
ISC License.  The ISC License isn't wrong.  Especially if
you didn't know "license?" would be one of the questions.

But I've noticed that when it comes to community and
collaboration matters---choice of revision control tool,
code host, distribution network, contribution policies,
licenses, and so on---we tend to reach more readily, not
less, for superlatives like "best practices", "the right
way", "the norm", and the like.  We imply not only
confidence in the wisdom of our choices, borne of our
limited experience in some relatively small corner of the
overall open source picture, but confidence in their
exclusive and universal _correctness_.  Often, that's only
as true as our corner is wide.  In reality, what we're doing
is convention over configuration, version 2.0.  Convention
for how code gets made, rather than what code does, or how.

Careful, experienced hands choosing conventions can
massively empower greener folk following timidly after them.
To give a personal example, I shudder to think just how much
about SQL data stores I "learned" from DHH's Ruby on Rails
screencasts.  Things about data stores those screencasts
seemed to assume I already knew.  Things `rails create`
assumed I wanted.

I didn't know much of anything about SQL data stores back
then.  If I knew what I wanted, it probably wasn't very
good.  Oddly enough, now that I do know a thing or two, I
find myself using SQL data stores less and less often.  I
went from using SQL for everything under the sun, because it
was what I knew, or what I felt good about knowing, and part
of package that impressed me, to a more nuanced view.  SQL
data stores weren't the "right answer", at least outside of
the Rails mentality.  For a time, however, I think SQL data
stores, one chapter in an obscure tome of Rails
conventionality, were good for me, as a programmer.

That's a good open source story, isn't it? Starts in the
middle of nowhere in Texas.  Ends today, in the San
Francisco Bay Area, neck deep in the open source community,
paying the bills.  One step in front of the other in
between.  Having choices made for me.  Making more and more
choices on my own.  Revisiting those that were made for me
before.  Full circle.

Why can't governance, licensing, collaboration, community
norms, and the rest be part of that kind of story? Perhaps
we should be more careful, less willing to hold the "best
practices" we advocate today out as truly and always best,
more mindful to show our work on them.  But why impose that
doubt on newcomers now, before they've had their own chances
to come all the way around?

Because governance decisions, culture decisions, community
decisions, and legal decisions are different.  Their medium
is people, not code.  People are not so easily replaceable,
so fundamentally mutable.  Neither are relations among them.
Collaborative relationships.  Legal relationships.  Power
relationships.

One the problems we don't know how to solve is "open source
sustainability".  We define open source sustainability
variously, but every definition not so reductionist as to be
helplessly boring is an unsolved problem.

I like to think of "sustainability" in terms of people who
give into open source software getting at least much out, in
ways and at times.
