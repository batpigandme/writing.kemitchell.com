title: Defunct Economics

When open software people talk about funding issues in economic terms, we often point two ways at once.  We look to economics for solutions to our problems, for reassurance they aren't totally new or intractable.  But at the same time, we often treat economics as a field with more to learn from open software than to teach to it.  A field whose orthodoxies and outgrowths, like strong and expanding intellectual property laws, are challenged or even shattered by open software practices and success.

Our blogosphere burbles with new interest in Elinor Ostrom. We cast sideways glances at blockchain, where West Coast software wizard culture and East finance masters-of-the-universe culture meet.  But riffling through the most credible looking, well regarded, heavily cited writing on the matter, you'd have to wonder why.  To read those classics tell it, the funding issue was a solved issue, or maybe even a non-issue.  Many free and open faithful rejoiced at this apparent rout of prevailing wisdom.  But at some point, evidently the problem wasn't so solved anymore.  It sure isn't now.

I've yet to find an economist who's surprised.  After all, economists have had a general-purpose solution for the problem of maximizing investment in useful works for ages: make them property.  And economists were plenty aware that some kinds of work aren't primarily physical stuff, like land or grain, and differ in key ways like how much they cost to make and share.  Making useful works that aren't physical stuff into property gives us intellectual property.  Copyrights, patents, and trade secrets, three kinds of intellectual property, often apply to software.

Nine tenths of free and open licensing is opting out of that solution, by rejecting intellectual property law.  Open licensing turns copyrights, trade secrets, and even patents inside-out, so they no longer apply.  But having opted out of the solution, open licensing opts back into the problem.  It veers off the well paved legal and financial road, right back into the jungle.

None of the economic thinking at play here is new or cutting-edge.  In the United States, we see it laid out in our federal constitution, from 1787:

> The Congress shall have Power ... To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries ...

The drafters of the federal constitution probably wouldn't have called copyrights and patents "intellectual property".  But we definitely call the kinds of exclusive rights they provided for in the constitution "intellectual property" today.

Property means exclusive rights.  When I own land as property, called "real property", I have the right to exclude you from visiting it or using it.  When I own a hammer as property, called "personal property", I have the right to exclude you from using it or taking it away.  When I own a bit of code under trade secret and copyright, that's "intellectual property", I have the right to exclude you from seeing it, copying it, sharing it, and so on.  I can rely on those rights when I invest.  I can give up or transfer those rights, by license, lease, or sale, for money that rewards my investment. The availability of money compensation for good investments encourages me to make more of them.  Freedom to negotiate helps ensure that my compensation is good if my work is valuable.

Without property rights, this neat theoretical chain from value to price to incentive breaks apart.  That's not to say people won't still do the work sometimes.  Only that when they do, they likely won't be compensated for its value.  And on the other side, some people who could do the work, but couldn't or wouldn't without proper financial incentive, whether for lack of interest or because they aren't as well off, won't bother.  Those who do probably won't have good compensation, and those who need appropriate pay won't have good incentive.

Say Jane writes a very useful piece of software, investing hours of work and years of experience.  She takes a big, speculative leap of faith and gives it away for free online.  Many users find it valuable, even essential.  They make a lot of money relying upon it.  Meanwhile, the project takes off, helped by the fact that it costs next to nothing.  The software doesn't cost any time, money, or effort, and neither does the process of getting the software and securing legal rights to use it.  The sticker price is zero, but so are the "transaction costs".

The result is a "collective action problem".  Jane made a big investment, and both for her sake and to keep good incentives, all involved want to see fair compensation flow back her way.  What's more, the software needs ongoing maintenance, and Jane's just the one to do it.  Clearly then, users ought to pay Jane, both for work done and for work to be done.  But that's very difficult now.  Who will pay?  How much?  On what terms?  When?  If we come up with a plan that answers all those questions, how will users commit to follow it?

If Jane hadn't given her software away, but instead sold licenses, transaction costs would have come due earlier, as each new user bought its own license.  But each user could have decided on their own, for themself, whether to buy in.  Giving the software away up-front deferred the transaction costs.  But it also turned the choice to support Jane's investments in the project from an individual choice into a collective choice.  Any user that chooses on to pay Jane on its own probably ends up covering for other users who don't, or "free riders".  Who wants to be the first to commit to pay?

Even if users pay Jane to continue work, Jane's unlikely to see fair money for what she's delivered.

For one, all her leverage for all the work she's done in the past is gone.  The only thing she can hold back on now, to make sure she gets paid fairly, is the maintenance work she has yet to do.

For two, especially if only some users step forward to pay her, she's stuck working out a deal in a way that wants to find out how little users have to pay to keep her working, not how much they're willing to pay.  Selling licenses, Jane could have experimented with her price until she found the point where she made the most money.  Doing a deal after the fact, users start offering $0 and go up until Jane is willing to do the work.

We can put ways to deal with this kind of problem in a few big groups.  We can talk about ways to tackle the collective action problem.  We can think about ways to connect the work to other projects where the value chain from investment to compensation and incentives isn't broken.  And finally, we can discuss ways to reintroduce property rights in the work, to avoid the problem in the first place.
