title: Defunct Economics
---

When open software people talk about funding issues in economic terms, we often point two ways at once.  We look to economics for solutions to our problems, for reassurance they aren't totally new or intractable.  But at the same time, we often treat economics as a field with more to learn from open software than to teach to it.  A field whose orthodoxies and outgrowths, like strong and expanding intellectual property laws, are challenged or even shattered by open software practices and success.

This inconsistency really jumps out on the funding problem.  Many of us who've worked our way up from specific personal experiences to top-down views have turned to economics, both as a way to talk about what's going wrong at that high level and as a source of potentially general, software-wide solutions.  Our blogosphere bubbles with new interest in Elinor Ostrom and blockchain, where West Coast software wizard culture and East finance masters-of-the-universe culture meet.  But riffling through the most credible looking, well regarded, heavily cited writing on the matter, you'd have to wonder why.  The funding issue was a solved issue, or even, apparently, a non-issue.  The free and open faithful rejoiced at this fact.  Then, at some point, somehow, it wasn't so solved anymore.  It sure isn't now.

I've yet to find an economist who's surprised.  After all, economists have a general-purpose solution for the problem of maximizing investment in useful works: make them property.  And economists were plenty aware that some kinds of work aren't primarily physical stuff, like land or grain, and differ in key ways like how much they cost to make and share.  Making useful works that aren't physical stuff into property gives us intellectual property.  Copyrights, patents, and trade secrets, three kinds of intellectual property, often apply to software.

None of this is new, cutting-edge economic thinking.  In the United States, we see exactly this plan laid out in our federal constitution:

> The Congress shall have Power ... To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries ...

The drafters of the federal constitution probably wouldn't have called copyrights and patents "intellectual property".  But we definitely call the kinds of "exclusive Right" they provided for in the constitution "intellectual property" today.  All property is exclusive rights.  When I own land as property, called "real property", I have the right to exclude you from visiting it or using it.  When I own a hammer as property, called "personal property", I have the right to exclude you from using it or taking it away.  I can rely on those rights to invest in the property.  And I can give up or transfer those rights, by lease or sale, for money to compensate me for my investments.
