title: Defunct Economics
---

When open software people talk about funding issues in economic terms, we often point two ways at once.  We look to economics for solutions to our problems, for reassurance they aren't totally new or intractable.  But at the same time, we often treat economics as a field with more to learn from open software than to teach us.  A field whose orthodoxies and outgrowths, like strong and expanding intellectual property laws, were shattered by open software's success.

So our blogosphere burbles with new interest in Elinor Ostrom. And we cast sideways glances at blockchain, where West Coast software wizard culture and East finance masters-of-the-universe culture meet.  But riffling through the most credible looking, well regarded, heavily cited writing on the matter, you'd have to wonder why.  To read those classics, the funding issue was a solved issue, maybe even a non-issue.  And many free and open faithful rejoiced at this apparent rout of conventional wisdom.  But at some point, evidently the problem wasn't so solved anymore.  It sure isn't now.

I've yet to find an economist who's surprised by this turnabout.  After all, economists have had a general-purpose solution for the problem of maximizing investment in useful works for ages: make them property.  They were plenty aware that some kinds of work aren't primarily physical stuff, like land or grain, and differ in key ways like how much they cost to make and share.  Making property out of things that aren't land or physical objects wasn't uncharted territory.  It was just "intellectual property", like copyrights, patents, and trade secrets, which often apply to software.

Trouble is, nine tenths of free and open licensing is legal magic spells to out out of the economic solution to funding valuable work, by rejecting intellectual property law.  Open licensing turns copyrights, trade secrets, and even patents inside-out, so they no longer apply.  But having opted out of the solution, open licensing opts back into the problem.

None of the economic thinking involved here is new or cutting-edge.  In the United States, we see it laid out in our federal constitution, from 1787:

> The Congress shall have Power ... To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries ...

The drafters of the federal constitution probably wouldn't have called copyrights and patents "intellectual property".  But we definitely call the kinds of exclusive rights they had in mind "intellectual property" today.

After all, "property" means exclusive rights.  When I own land as property, "real property", I have the right to exclude you from visiting it or using it.  When I own a hammer as property, "personal property", I have the right to exclude you from using it or taking it away.  When I own a bit of code under trade secret and copyright, as "intellectual property", I have the right to exclude you from seeing it, copying it, sharing it, and so on.

I can rely on those rights when I invest.  I can give up or transfer those rights, by license, lease, or sale, for money that rewards my investment. The availability of good compensation for good investments encourages me to make more good investments.  Freedom to negotiate helps ensure I'm well taken care of if my work is valuable.

Without property rights, this neat theoretical chain from value to price to incentive breaks apart.  That's not to say people won't still do the work.  But when they do, we expect they won't be compensated in due measure.  And on the other side, some people who could do the work, but couldn't or wouldn't without proper financial incentive, whether for lack of interest or because they aren't as well off, likely won't be able, or won't bother.

Say Jane writes a very useful piece of software, investing years of experience and hours and hours of work.  She takes a big, speculative leap of faith and gives it away for free online.  Many users find it valuable, even essential.  They make a lot of money on it.  So Jane's project takes off, helped by the fact that it costs basically nil.  The software doesn't cost any time or money, and neither does the process of getting the software and securing legal rights to use it.  The sticker price is zero, but so are the "transaction costs", the costs of the process of getting the thing in hand.

The result is a "collective action problem".  Jane made a big investment, and both for her sake and to for the sake of good incentives, all involved want to see fair compensation flow back her way.  What's more, the software needs ongoing maintenance, and Jane is just the one, maybe the only one, to do it.  Clearly then, users ought to pay Jane, both for work done and for work to be done.  But that's very difficult to figure out now.  Who will pay?  How much?  On what terms?  When?  If we come up with a plan that answers all these questions, how will hold all the users to it?

If Jane hadn't given her software away, but instead sold licenses to user her work, transaction costs would have come due earlier, as each new user bought its own license.  The popularity of her project probably wouldn't have taken off so much.  But each user of the software could have decided on their own, for themselves, whether to buy in.  Giving the software away up-front deferred both the cost of the software and the transaction costs of getting it.  But it also turned the choice to support Jane's investments in the project from a bunch of individual choices into one big group choice, a "collective action problem".  See, any user that chooses on to pay Jane on its own probably ends up covering for other users who don't, or "free riders".  Who wants to be the first sucker to commit to pay?  But who can force all the users to come together, to honor a deal about how the cost will be spread?

In any event, even if users pay Jane to continue work, Jane's unlikely to see fair due for what she's delivered.

For one, all her leverage for the work she's done in the past is gone.  She did the work and gave it away, so any interest in getting her fairly compensated for it isn't so much about her, or the work that she has done, but the principle of the thing, for the effect on incentives for others.  As for Jane, the only thing she can hold back on now, to make sure she gets paid well, is the maintenance work she has yet to do.  The work she could do in the future, and might choose not to do if the terms aren't right.

For two, especially if only some users step forward to pay, Jane's stuck working out a deal in a way that wants to find out just how little she needs to keep at it, not how much users are willing to pay for the value of her work.  Selling licenses, Jane could have moved her price up and down until she found the most users, as a whole, were willing to pay.  Doing a deal after the fact, users start offering $0 and go up until Jane is willing to do the work.

We can put ways to deal with this kind of problem in a few big groups.  We can talk about ways to tackle the collective action problem.  We can think about ways to connect the work to other projects where the value chain from investment to compensation and incentives isn't broken.  And finally, we can discuss ways to reintroduce property rights in the work, to avoid the problem in the first place.
