title: Defunct Economics
---

When open software people talk about funding issues in economic terms, we often contradict ourselves.  On one hand, we look to economics for solutions to our problems, for reassurance they aren't new and can be solved.  At the same time, we often treat economics as a field with more to learn from open software than to teach to it.  A field whose orthodoxies and outgrowths, like intellectual property law, were challenged or even shattered by open software practice as it rose.

The inconsistency really jumps out on the funding problem.  Many of us who've worked our way from specific personal experiences to top-down views have turned to economics, both as a way to talk about what's going wrong at that high level and as a source of potentially general, software-wide solutions.  Our blogosphere bubbles with new interest in Elinor Ostrom and the blockchain community, where West Coast software wizard culture and East finance masters-of-the-universe culture collide.  But riffling through the most credible looking, well regarded, heavily cited writing on the matter, you'd have to wonder why.  The funding issue was apparently a solved issue.  The free and open faithful rejoiced.  Then, at some point, somehow, it wasn't anymore.  It sure isn't now.
