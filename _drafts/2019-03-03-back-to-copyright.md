How should society support creation and maintenance of public goods in the private sector?  Obvious answer: intellectual property law.  The public policy behind modern IP law gives creators of ideas and expressions the right to make others pay for their benefits, and to sue those who don't, so they can recoup costs and keep up the good work.

[Write a book?  Have a copyright.  Disclose a discovery to the government?  Have a patent.  Compile a valuable client list?  Take security precautions, we'll back them with the law.](https://fieldguide.kemitchell.com)

In the case of open source software specifically, the obvious answer to the question of how open source software developers should command financial support is to let open source developers to charge users for copyright licenses.  But open source means the right to use, without paying anybody for the privilege.  Open source developers make software open-source by [reversing copyright and other IP laws](https://oss.kemitchell.com), casting society's official means of support aside.  Policymakers have been so sure of that means---[making nonexcludable ideas excludable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excludability)---that they apply it to qualifying software by default, like it or not.

Of course there's an "open source sustainability" problem.  Open source chooses to opt out of society's fix for public-good finance.  Opting _out_ of the fix is opting _in_ to the problem.  Releasing open source?  Here's the finance problem you ordered.

This is _not_ to say that the present policy justification and political history of copyright or other intellectual property laws coincide.  They don't.  Nor does the current policy entirely jibe with reality.  Intellectual property rights allotted to individual creators, by default, often end up belonging to employers and clients.  The exception of corporate ownership is swallowing the rule of individual creator empowerment.
