brief:  Software activists can turn the two-edged sword of cross-licensing around on industry as a cheap, flexible, international means of economic self-organization.

If they learn from you, but you don't learn from them, you can expect to get fucked.

The software industry has learned a lot from software activists.  It uses their methods, their infrastructure, and tons of their software.  But software activists have utterly failed to keep learning from industry.  More than thirty years ago, software activists seized a lever of industry power, copyright, and turned it around against industry misdeeds en masse, through copyleft.  The hot new stuff of software collaboration has been mostly scraps off the industry table since then.

Nowhere is this more clear than where mantras meet the moolah.  Software freedom orthodoxy has long chanted no problem with business.  The FSF itself sold copies of its software---on tape, back when that worked---to finance early days, and RMS recommended selling exceptions as a model to others.  But software freedom activism "isn't against money" like the lactose-intolerant "isn't against ice cream".  Others do as they do, but if an organization isn't a nonprofit charity, many Stallmanites simply aren't interested.  Still others rush to voice suspicion, laced with a note of tactfully suppressed, pious revulsion.

As a result, software activists lack a cheap, scalable, international method of economic organization, and therefore economic organization more generally.  They know how to set up foundations and sponsorships, but those can't attract investment or pay dividends.  They know how to start and manage copyleft projects, but the only naturally coordinated activity of those projects is opting out of the money system.  When just one contributor---perhaps the company that released the project to begin with---retains a right to "monetize" systematically, some cry foul.  I won't pretend to understand why.  But I can't pretend I don't see the consequences.

As a consequence, the work of developing software that competes with industry remains a shoestring, precariously funded, intrinsically motivated kind of affair, largely uncoupled from the economic engine of inspiration.  It subsists on the effort of relatively privileged allies with time, taxable dollars, and energy to spare, only rarely with the input of indifferent neutrals or hireling guns.  Success cases tend to involve lots of contribution from salarymen whose colleagues use the software to build closed software and services.

Software activism---and not just the FSF strain---needs a new vehicle not just for collective development, but collective business.  It can build that vehicle by repurposing a signature tool of "enterprise" competitive engineering: the cross-license.

Experienced hackers already understand cross-licensing, intellectually and instinctively.  Happening upon a copyleft-licensed project, many know that's not the end of the situation.  Does the project require copyright assignment, or a special license agreement, from contributors?  That kind of requirement vests _someone_ with special licensing powers.  Are they nonprofit or for profit?  Do their special powers include selling exceptions to the rule of sharing back alike?

<!-- TODO: Distinguish projects that are "locked open" versus those with CLAs that preserve dual licensing capability.  Pivot from there to cross-licensing that involves all contributors in economic activity. -->
