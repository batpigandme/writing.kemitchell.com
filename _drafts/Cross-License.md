brief:  A new form of organization

If they learn from you, but you don't learn from them, you can expect to get fucked.

The software industry has learned a lot from software activists.  It uses their methods, their infrastructure, and tons of their software.  But software activists have utterly failed to keep learning from industry.  Not since more than thirty years ago did software activists effectively seize a lever of industry power, copyright, and turn it around against industry misdeeds en masse, as copyleft.

Nowhere is this more clear than where mantra meets money.  Software freedom orthodoxy has long chanted no problem with making any.  The FSF itself sold copies of its software---on tape, back when that worked---to finance early days, and RMS recommended selling exceptions to others.  But software freedom activism generally "isn't against money" more or less like most lactose-intolerants aren't against ice cream.  Others will do as they do, but if an organization isn't a nonprofit charity, many Stallmanites simply aren't interested.  Still others proclaim suspicion, laced with a note of tactfully suppressed revulsion.

As a result, software activists lack a cheap, scalable, international means of economic organization, and therefore economic organization more generally.  They know how to set up foundations, but those can't attract investment or pay dividends.  They know how to start and manage projects, but those can only opt out of the software economy.  When only one contributor---perhaps the company that released the project to begin with---retains the right to "monetize", some cry foul.

As a consequence, the work of developing activist software that competes with industry alternatives remains a shoestring, precariously funded, intrinsically motivated kind of affair overall, uncoupled from the engine of economic inspiration.  It subsists on the effort of relatively privileged allies with time and energy to spare, with rare input from indifferent neutrals or hireling guns.

Software activism---and not just the FSF strain---needs a new vehicle not just for collective development, but collective business.  It can build that vehicle with a signature tool of "enterprise"-scale competitive engineering: the cross-license.

<!-- TODO: Distinguish projects that are "locked open" versus those with CLAs that preserve dual licensing capability.  Pivot from there to cross-licensing that involves all contributors in economic activity. -->
