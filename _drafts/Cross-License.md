If they can learn from you, but you don't learn from them, expect to get fucked.

The software industry has learned a lot from software activists.  It uses their methods, their infrastructure, and tons of their software.  But software activists have utterly failed to keep learning from industry.  Not since copyleft, more than thirty years ago, have software activists effectively seized a lever of industry power---in that case, copyright---and turned it around against industry misdeeds en masse.

Nowhere is this more clear than where software meets money.  Software freedom orthodoxy has long held that software freedom takes no umbrage at anyone making money.  The FSF itself sold copies of its software---on tape, back when that worked---to finance early days.  But software freedom activism isn't against money in software like the lactose-intolerant aren't against ice cream.  If an organization isn't nonprofit, or charitable, many Stallmanites simple aren't interested.  Some are revulsed.

As a result, software activists utterly lack a cheap, scalable, international means of economic organization.  They know how to set up foundations, but those can't attract investment or pay dividends.  They know how to start and manage projects, but those can only share collective work for free.  When only one contributor---perhaps the company that released the project---retains the right to monetize, some cry foul.  So the work of developing activist software in competition with industry remains largely a shoestring, unfunded, intrinsically-motivated kind of affair.  It remains uncoupled from the engine of economic inspiration.  It benefits only from the effort of privileged allies, rarely from neutrals or hireable guns.

Software activism---and not just FSF-style activism---needs a new vehicle not just for collective development, but collective business.  It can build that vehicle with the toolkit of.
