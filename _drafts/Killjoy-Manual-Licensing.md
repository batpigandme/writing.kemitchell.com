This is a post in a series, _Killjoy_, in which I examine unorthodox, unwelcome solutions to nagging open source problems.

One of the great innovations in open source licensing is _putting public license terms in files that follow the source code around_.  Files like `LICENSE`.  This practice goes back to software distributions on physical media, like tape drives.  Wherever the software went, so went a copy of its license terms.  The license terms required new copies, compiled or source, to traveled along with copies of the license terms, too.

Now we have the Internet.  The Internet lets us replace copies of things with access to things.  Like licenses.

Flying blind, wondering how many folks are using your open source software, and how they are?  Looking to keep a roster of users, to bug for support when spending your time on maintenance doesn't make financial sense?  Looking to turn your open source work into employment at a company in the field?  Want to sell licenses, rather than give them away?

Delete your `LICENSE` file, and replace it with a note about how to get in touch with you for a license via the Internet.  When folks get in touch, offer them licenses on whatever terms you please, directly.  For sale.  For free.  Whatever works for you and your project.
