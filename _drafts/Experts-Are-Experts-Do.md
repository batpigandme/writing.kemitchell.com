title: Experts Are as Experts Do
---

[Ari Schulman's "The Coronavirus and the Right's Scientific Counterrevolution"](https://newrepublic.com/article/158058/coronavirus-conservative-experts-scientific-counterrevolution), for The New Republic last month, sticks with me.  The title is shit.  As is the commissioned Photoshop art-o-graphic.  But in the words---and there are a lot of them---lies a lot to mull and ponder.  A deep, dark, challenging hole.

Those still willing to commit to a long article about politics and the coronavirus might enjoy.  It occupies that genre.  But I recommend in a somewhat different light.  As something legal colleagues would do well to read.  And, indulging just a moment, I think the piece can crystallize a learnable moment for experts writ large, which might otherwise slip by.
